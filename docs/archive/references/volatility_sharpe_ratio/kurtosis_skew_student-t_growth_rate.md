### **Including the Fourth Moment (Kurtosis) in the Geometric Growth Rate**

The geometric growth rate $$ G $$ can be expanded using a Taylor series or cumulant expansion to include higher-order moments of the return distribution. The approximation up to the fourth moment is:

$$
G \approx \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} - \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4}{24}
$$

Where:

- $$ \mu $$ is the arithmetic mean return.
- $$ \sigma^2 $$ is the variance of returns.
- $$ \gamma_3 $$ is the skewness (third standardized moment).
- $$ \gamma_4 $$ is the kurtosis (fourth standardized moment).
- $$ \gamma_4 - 3 $$ represents **excess kurtosis**, since the kurtosis of the normal distribution is 3.

---

### **Derivation and Explanation**

#### **1. Base Formula**

The geometric growth rate is linked to the expected value of the logarithm of returns:

$$
G = E[\ln(1 + R)]
$$

For small returns, we can expand $$ \ln(1 + R) $$ using a Taylor series:

$$
\ln(1 + R) \approx R - \frac{R^2}{2} + \frac{R^3}{3} - \frac{R^4}{4} + \dots
$$

Taking expectations:

$$
G \approx E[R] - \frac{E[R^2]}{2} + \frac{E[R^3]}{3} - \frac{E[R^4]}{4} + \dots
$$

#### **2. Expressing Moments in Terms of Central Moments**

We can express raw moments in terms of central moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis):

- **Second Raw Moment:** $$ E[R^2] = \sigma^2 + \mu^2 $$
- **Third Raw Moment:** $$ E[R^3] = \gamma_3 \sigma^3 + 3\mu\sigma^2 + \mu^3 $$
- **Fourth Raw Moment:** $$ E[R^4] = (\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4 + 6\mu^2\sigma^2 + \mu^4 + 3\sigma^4 $$

However, for small $$ \mu $$ (which is common in financial return series where the mean return is small compared to volatility), we can approximate by neglecting higher-order terms involving $$ \mu^2 $$ and above:

$$
E[R^2] \approx \sigma^2 \\
E[R^3] \approx \gamma_3 \sigma^3 \\
E[R^4] \approx (\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4 + 3\sigma^4
$$

Note that $$ \gamma_4 - 3 $$ is the excess kurtosis.

#### **3. Final Approximation**

Substituting back into the expansion:

$$
G \approx \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} - \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3 + 3)\sigma^4}{24}
$$

Simplify the kurtosis term:

$$
(\gamma_4 - 3 + 3) = \gamma_4
$$

But since the normal kurtosis is 3, excess kurtosis is $$ \gamma_4 - 3 $$. Therefore, considering excess kurtosis:

$$
G \approx \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} - \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4}{24} - \frac{3\sigma^4}{24}
$$

Since $$ \frac{3\sigma^4}{24} = \frac{\sigma^4}{8} $$, but this term is constant for all distributions and often absorbed in approximation errors or considered negligible compared to the excess kurtosis term. For practical purposes, we focus on the excess kurtosis adjustment:

$$
G \approx \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} - \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4}{24}
$$

---

### **Applying to the Skewed Student's t-Distribution**

Incorporating the effect of skewness and kurtosis into the geometric growth rate for the skewed Student's t-distribution, you extend your previous formula:

#### **Previous Formula:**

$$
G_{skewed-t} = \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \times \frac{2}{v - 2} + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6}
$$

#### **Extended Formula with Kurtosis:**

Add the kurtosis term:

$$
G_{skewed-t} = \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} - \left( \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \times \frac{2}{v - 2} \right) + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} - \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4}{24}
$$

#### **Details:**

- **Variance Adjustment for Heavy Tails:** The term $$ \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \times \frac{2}{v - 2} $$ accounts for the contribution of heavy tails to the variance effect on the growth rate due to the Student's t-distribution with $$ v $$ degrees of freedom.
- **Skewness Adjustment:** $$ \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} $$ adds the impact of skewness.
- **Kurtosis Adjustment:** $$ \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4}{24} $$ subtracts the impact of excess kurtosis.

---

### **Calculating Excess Kurtosis for Student's t-Distribution**

For the (non-skewed) Student's t-distribution, the excess kurtosis is:

$$
\gamma_4 - 3 = \frac{6}{v - 4} \quad \text{for} \quad v > 4
$$

- **Note:** The kurtosis is only defined for $$ v > 4 $$.

Substituting into the kurtosis term:

$$
- \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4}{24} = - \frac{\left( \frac{6}{v - 4} \right) \sigma^4}{24} = - \frac{\sigma^4}{4(v - 4)}
$$

---

### **Final Formula for Skewed Student's t-Distribution with Kurtosis**

Combining all the adjustments:

$$
G_{skewed-t} = \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2}{v - 2} + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} - \frac{\sigma^4}{4(v - 4)}
$$

**Simplified Steps:**

1. **Variance Drag:**

   - Standard: $$ -\frac{\sigma^2}{2} $$
   - Student's t Adjustment: $$ -\frac{\sigma^2}{v - 2} $$

2. **Skewness Adjustment:**

   - $$ +\frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} $$

3. **Kurtosis Adjustment:**

   - $$ -\frac{\sigma^4}{4(v - 4)} $$

---

### **Interpretation**

- **Variance Drag:** Increased variance reduces the geometric mean due to the compounding effect of volatility.
- **Heavy Tails (Student's t):** The additional variance drag from the Student's t-distribution accounts for the increased probability of extreme returns.
- **Skewness:** Positive skewness increases the geometric mean, as large positive returns contribute more to geometric growth. Negative skewness decreases it.
- **Kurtosis (Excess Kurtosis):** High kurtosis (fat tails) increases the risk of extreme returns (both positive and negative). The negative adjustment reflects the idea that the increased variability reduces the average compounded growth rate.

---

### **Important Considerations**

- **Applicability of Moments:**
  - **Degrees of Freedom Constraints:**
    - Skewness ($$ \gamma_3 $$) exists for $$ v > 3 $$.
    - Kurtosis ($$ \gamma_4 $$) exists for $$ v > 4 $$.
  - Ensure that $$ v $$ is sufficiently large to calculate these moments.

- **Approximation Validity:**
  - The approximation improves with smaller $$ \sigma $$ and when higher-order terms are negligible.
  - For distributions with extremely fat tails or high volatility, higher-order terms may be significant.

- **Practical Use:**
  - Including the fourth moment provides a more accurate estimation of geometric growth, particularly for assets with high kurtosis.
  - Useful in risk management, portfolio optimization, and understanding the long-term impact of return distributions on wealth accumulation.

---

### **Summary**

By incorporating the fourth central moment (kurtosis) into your formula, you can more accurately estimate the geometric growth rate for distributions exhibiting significant skewness and kurtosis. The adjusted formula considers the impacts of mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis on geometric growth, providing a comprehensive view of how the distribution's characteristics affect long-term returns.

**Final Adjusted Formula:**

$$
G_{skewed-t} = \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} - \frac{\sigma^2}{v - 2} + \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} - \frac{\sigma^4}{4(v - 4)}
$$

This formula enhances the classical variance drag adjustment by incorporating the effects of heavy tails (kurtosis) and asymmetry (skewness), leading to better-informed financial decision-making.

## Can we isolate the left tail drag for risk budgeting of tail hedging?

Your question touches on an important consideration when assessing the impact of higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) on the geometric growth rate and isolating the contribution from the left tail of the return distribution. Specifically, you're proposing that since kurtosis affects both tails equally in a symmetric distribution, we could attribute half of the kurtosis drag to the left tail. Thus, the left-tail drag would be:

$$
\text{Left-Tail Drag} = \text{Skewness Drag} + \frac{\text{Kurtosis Drag}}{2}
$$

You acknowledge that this may be an oversimplification and are interested in understanding how far this approximation is from reality, assuming a perfect fit of the distribution to observed returns.

---

### **Isolating Left-Tail Drag: Is the Simplification Reasonable?**

Let's analyze this proposal step by step to assess its validity and limitations.

#### **1. Kurtosis and Its Impact on Tails**

- **Definition of Kurtosis**: Kurtosis ($$ \gamma_4 $$) measures the "tailedness" of a probability distribution. High kurtosis indicates heavier tails than the normal distribution.
  
- **Symmetric Distributions**: In symmetric distributions (like the standard Student's t-distribution), kurtosis affects both tails equally because the probability density function (PDF) is mirror-symmetric around the mean.

- **Skewed Distributions**: In skewed distributions, the symmetry is broken, but kurtosis generally still quantifies the overall tail heaviness without specifying which tail contributes more.

#### **2. Your Simplification**

- **Assumption**: Since kurtosis affects both tails equally, half of the kurtosis drag could be attributed to the left tail.

- **Formula Proposal**: By adding the skewness drag (which directly affects the left tail when skewness is negative) and half of the kurtosis drag, you aim to estimate the left-tail drag.

#### **3. Evaluating the Simplification**

To assess how close this approximation is to reality, we'll consider:

- **Theoretical Justification**
- **Impact of Skewness on Kurtosis**
- **Practical Implications**

---

### **Theoretical Justification**

#### **A. Kurtosis in Symmetric vs. Skewed Distributions**

- **Symmetric Distributions**: In perfectly symmetric distributions, the effect of kurtosis on each tail is indeed equal.

- **Skewed Distributions**: In skewed distributions, the tails are not symmetric. While kurtosis still measures the overall tail heaviness, the contribution to each tail may not be equal due to the interaction with skewness.

#### **B. Decomposition of Kurtosis**

- **Moment Measures**: Moments beyond the second (variance) in skewed distributions can be complex due to the interplay between skewness and kurtosis.

- **Edgeworth Expansion**: Advanced statistical techniques, like the Edgeworth or Gram-Charlier expansions, illustrate that higher-order terms involve combinations of skewness and kurtosis.

#### **C. Approximating Tail Contributions**

- **Simplification Validity**: Dividing the kurtosis drag by 2 assumes equal contribution from both tails, which may not hold in skewed distributions.

- **Interaction Between Skewness and Kurtosis**: In skewed distributions, kurtosis may be distributed unevenly between the tails, making the assumption less accurate.

---

### **Impact of Skewness on Kurtosis**

#### **A. Skewness Affects the Distribution of Kurtosis**

- **Skewness Definition**: Skewness ($$ \gamma_3 $$) measures the asymmetry of the distribution.

- **Kurtosis in Skewed Distributions**: In a negatively skewed distribution, the left tail is heavier, and more of the excess kurtosis may be attributable to the left tail.

#### **B. Empirical Findings**

- **Studies on Tail Behavior**: Empirical studies often find that in skewed distributions, the heavier tail contributes more to the excess kurtosis.

- **Implication for Your Simplification**: Assuming an equal split of kurtosis between tails may underestimate the left-tail contribution in negatively skewed distributions.

---

### **Practical Implications**

#### **A. Perfect Fit Assumption**

- **Assumption of Perfect Fit**: You're assuming that the skewed Student's t-distribution perfectly fits the observed returns.

- **Benefit**: This reduces concerns about model misspecification and focuses the analysis on the mathematical properties of the distribution.

#### **B. Quantitative Assessment**

**Let's perform a quantitative example to see the potential error in the simplification.**

**Given:**

- **Mean ($$ \mu $$)**: Assume negligible for simplicity.
- **Volatility ($$ \sigma = 0.2 $$)**
- **Skewness ($$ \gamma_3 = -1 $$)**: Negative skewness.
- **Degrees of Freedom ($$ v = 6 $$)**

**Compute the Adjustments:**

1. **Variance Drag:**

   $$
   \text{Variance Drag} = -\frac{\sigma^2}{2} = -\frac{0.04}{2} = -0.02
   $$

2. **Heavy Tail (Kurtosis) Drag:**

   - **First, compute excess kurtosis for the Student's t-distribution:**

     $$
     \text{Excess Kurtosis} = \gamma_4 - 3 = \frac{6}{v - 4} = \frac{6}{6 - 4} = 3
     $$

   - **Calculate Kurtosis Drag:**

     $$
     \text{Kurtosis Drag} = -\frac{(\gamma_4 - 3) \sigma^4}{24} = -\frac{3 \times (0.04)^2}{24} = -\frac{3 \times 0.0016}{24} = -0.0002
     $$

3. **Skewness Drag:**

   $$
   \text{Skewness Drag} = \frac{\gamma_3 \sigma^3}{6} = \frac{(-1) \times (0.008)}{6} = -0.00133
   $$

4. **Total Drag from Skewness and Kurtosis:**

   $$
   \text{Total Drag} = \text{Skewness Drag} + \text{Kurtosis Drag} = -0.00133 - 0.0002 = -0.00153
   $$

5. **Approximate Left-Tail Drag:**

   - **Using Your Simplification:**

     $$
     \text{Left-Tail Drag} = \text{Skewness Drag} + \frac{\text{Kurtosis Drag}}{2} = -0.00133 - \frac{0.0002}{2} = -0.00143
     $$

**Analysis:**

- **Difference Between Total Drag and Left-Tail Drag Simplification:**

  $$
  \text{Difference} = \text{Total Drag} - \text{Left-Tail Drag} = -0.00153 - (-0.00143) = -0.0001
  $$

- **Relative Error:**

  $$
  \frac{|\text{Difference}|}{|\text{Total Drag}|} = \frac{0.0001}{0.00153} \approx 6.5\%
  $$

**Interpretation:**

- The simplification underestimates the total drag attributable to skewness and kurtosis by about 6.5% in this specific example.

- **Considering the Magnitude**: Given that the total drag is small in absolute terms, the error introduced is also small.

- **Potential Error Variation**: The error may increase with higher kurtosis or more pronounced skewness.

---

### **How Far from Reality Is the Simplification?**

#### **Factors Affecting Accuracy**

1. **Degree of Skewness and Kurtosis**

   - **Higher Skewness**: The more skewed the distribution, the more likely the kurtosis will be unevenly distributed between the tails.

   - **High Kurtosis**: With higher kurtosis, the potential error from assuming an equal split increases.

2. **Interaction Between Moments**

   - **Nonlinear Effects**: The interplay between skewness and kurtosis can produce nonlinear effects that are not captured by simply dividing the kurtosis drag by 2.

3. **Distribution Shape**

   - **Skewed Student's t-distribution**: While it allows for skewness, its properties may not align perfectly with the assumption of equal tail impact from kurtosis.

#### **Empirical Evidence**

- **Studies Suggest**: In practice, the left tail might contribute more significantly to excess kurtosis in negatively skewed distributions.

- **Possible Underestimation**: Your simplification might underestimate the left-tail drag, potentially leading to insufficient hedging against left-tail risks.

---

### **Conclusion**

#### **Validity of the Simplification**

- **Reasonable First Approximation**: For practical purposes and when seeking a straightforward estimation, your method provides a reasonable approximation, especially when skewness and kurtosis are not extreme.

- **Limitations**: The simplification may underestimate the left-tail drag in negatively skewed distributions with significant kurtosis.

#### **Assuming Perfect Fit**

- **Mitigates Model Error**: Assuming a perfect fit reduces concerns about distributional misspecification.

- **Cannot Eliminate Moment Interactions**: However, it does not address the inherent statistical interactions between skewness and kurtosis in skewed distributions.

---

### **Recommendations**

#### **1. Use Caution with Simplification**

- Recognize the potential for underestimation, especially with high skewness and kurtosis.

- Consider the simplification as a lower-bound estimate of left-tail drag.

#### **2. Consider Alternative Approaches**

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**

  - Simulate the distribution to empirically estimate the left-tail drag.

  - Capture the interactions between skewness and kurtosis more accurately.

- **Advanced Statistical Methods**

  - Use techniques like the Cornish-Fisher expansion, which adjusts quantiles based on skewness and kurtosis.

- **Tail-Specific Measures**

  - Calculate **Conditional Kurtosis**:

    - Measure kurtosis in the left tail only.

  - **Expected Shortfall (ES) or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**:

    - Provides a direct measure of expected losses in the left tail.

#### **3. Adjust Risk Budget Accordingly**

- **Add Margin for Error**: When allocating a risk budget for tail hedging, consider adding a buffer to account for potential underestimation.

- **Regularly Update Estimates**: As market conditions change, update your moment estimates and reassess the tail drag.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

- **Simplification Usefulness**: Your proposed method offers a practical and intuitive way to estimate left-tail drag, especially when a quick assessment is needed.

- **Awareness of Limitations**: It's important to be aware of the approximation's limitations and the conditions under which it may deviate from reality.

- **Balancing Complexity and Practicality**: While more sophisticated methods can provide greater accuracy, they also increase complexity. Choose the approach that best fits your analytical needs and resource availability.

# Sharpe Ratio improved Risk measure

**Summary:**

- **Yes**, it's possible to approximate the left-tail drag by adding the skewness drag to half of the kurtosis drag.

- **However**, this simplification may slightly underestimate the left-tail drag, especially in distributions with significant negative skewness and high kurtosis.

- **Assuming a perfect fit**, the approximation is reasonably close to reality for practical purposes, but it's important to recognize and account for its limitations when precision is critical.

**Introduction**

You've raised an important point about the limitations of the traditional **Sharpe Ratio** when applied to investment returns, especially over multiple periods with high volatility. Specifically, when returns are volatile, the **arithmetic mean return** can be misleading due to the **variance drag**, which reduces the **geometric mean return** (the actual compounded rate of growth). This discrepancy highlights the need for a performance metric that:

- Reflects the **true long-term performance** (using geometric returns).
- Uses a risk measure consistent with the geometric return.
- Addresses the inconsistencies in traditional measures.

In this response, we'll explore:

1. **Limitations of the Traditional Sharpe Ratio**
2. **Alternative Performance Metrics Based on Geometric Returns**
3. **Developing a Geometric Sharpe Ratio**
4. **Using Maximum Drawdown as a Risk Measure**
5. **Recommendations for a Better Performance Metric**

---

### **1. Limitations of the Traditional Sharpe Ratio**

The **Sharpe Ratio** is defined as:

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E[R] - R_f}{\sigma}
$$

Where:

- $$ E[R] $$: **Arithmetic mean return** of the portfolio.
- $$ R_f $$: **Risk-free rate**.
- $$ \sigma $$: **Standard deviation** of returns (often based on log returns).

**Issues with the Traditional Sharpe Ratio:**

- **Arithmetic Mean vs. Geometric Mean:**
  - The arithmetic mean does not account for the compounding effect over multiple periods.
  - In volatile markets, the arithmetic mean can overstate the expected return.
  - **Example:** As you mentioned, a series with returns of -50% and +60% has an arithmetic mean of +5%, but the portfolio actually loses 20% over the two periods, indicating a negative geometric return.

- **Inconsistency in Risk Measurement:**
  - The standard deviation is often calculated using **log returns**, which are additive over time and approximate the continuously compounded rate of return.
  - Using arithmetic returns in the numerator and log-return-based volatility in the denominator introduces inconsistency.

- **Variance Drag:**
  - High volatility reduces the geometric mean return due to the convex relationship between arithmetic and geometric returns.
  - The traditional Sharpe Ratio does not account for this variance drag.

---

### **2. Alternative Performance Metrics Based on Geometric Returns**

To address these issues, consider performance metrics that use the **geometric mean return** and risk measures more aligned with investors' experience of risk.

**A. Calmar Ratio**

- **Definition:**

  $$
  \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{CAGR}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}}
  $$

  - **CAGR**: **Compound Annual Growth Rate** (geometric mean return).
  - **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio's value.

- **Advantages:**
  - Uses geometric returns, reflecting true compounded growth.
  - Incorporates the **maximum drawdown**, capturing the worst-case loss experienced by the portfolio.

- **Limitations:**
  - Maximum drawdown is a historical measure and may not reflect future risks.
  - Can be sensitive to the time horizon and may not account for the frequency of drawdowns.

**B. Sterling Ratio**

- Similar to the Calmar Ratio but adjusts for average annual drawdowns beyond a threshold (e.g., 10%).

  $$
  \text{Sterling Ratio} = \frac{\text{CAGR}}{\text{Average Annual Drawdown} - 10\%}
  $$

**C. Sortino Ratio**

- Focuses on **downside risk** instead of overall volatility.

  $$
  \text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{E[R] - R_f}{\sigma_D}
  $$

  - $$ \sigma_D $$: **Downside deviation**, calculated using only negative returns relative to a target or the risk-free rate.
  - Can be adapted to use geometric returns in the numerator.

**D. Omega Ratio**

- Considers all moments of the return distribution.
- Defined as the ratio of gains to losses for a target return level.

---

### **3. Developing a Geometric Sharpe Ratio**

To align the performance metric with geometric returns and an appropriate risk measure, consider developing a **Geometric Sharpe Ratio**.

**A. Definition of Geometric Sharpe Ratio**

One approach is to redefine the Sharpe Ratio using the **geometric mean return**:

$$
\text{Geometric Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{G - R_f}{\sigma_G}
$$

Where:

- $$ G $$: **Geometric mean return** of the portfolio.
- $$ \sigma_G $$: A risk measure consistent with the geometric return.

**B. Determining an Appropriate Risk Measure ($$ \sigma_G $$)**

Since the geometric mean return accounts for compounding, the risk measure should reflect the variability in the compounded returns.

**Possible Risk Measures:**

1. **Standard Deviation of Log Returns (Volatility):**

   - Use the standard deviation of continuously compounded returns (log returns).
   - Reflects the variability in returns that affect the geometric mean.

2. **Variance Drag Adjustment:**

   - Recognize that volatility reduces the geometric mean.
   - Incorporate variance drag into the risk measure.

3. **Downside Risk Measures:**

   - Use **Downside Deviation** or **Semi-Variance**, focusing on negative returns that affect long-term growth.

4. **Maximum Drawdown:**

   - Reflects the largest loss that would directly impact the compounded growth of the portfolio.

**C. Proposed Geometric Sharpe Ratio with Adjusted Risk Measure**

Given the importance of drawdowns in affecting geometric returns, consider:

$$
\text{Geometric Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{G - R_f}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}}
$$

- This effectively becomes the **Calmar Ratio**, highlighting that the Calmar Ratio is a geometric return-based performance metric analogous to the Sharpe Ratio but using maximum drawdown as the risk measure.

---

### **4. Using Maximum Drawdown as a Risk Measure**

**A. Rationale**

- **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)** measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio's value.
- MDD directly impacts the investor's experience and the portfolio's ability to recover, affecting long-term compounded returns.
- Using MDD as the denominator aligns the risk measure with the **permanent loss of capital** concern, which is critical in long-term investing.

**B. Calculating Theoretical Maximum Drawdown**

- **Theoretical MDD** can be estimated using the return distribution's characteristics.
- For normal or log-normal distributions, MDD can be related to volatility and time horizon.
- For distributions with skewness and kurtosis, adjust the MDD estimation to account for the higher probability of extreme losses.

**C. Advantages**

- **Reflects Tail Risk**: MDD captures extreme negative outcomes that volatility may not fully represent.
- **Investor Relevance**: Investors are often more sensitive to large losses than to volatility.

**D. Limitations**

- **Historical vs. Theoretical**: Historical MDD may not predict future drawdowns.
- **Timing Sensitivity**: MDD depends on the time period analyzed.

---

### **5. Recommendations for a Better Performance Metric**

To create a performance metric that effectively balances geometric returns with an appropriate risk measure, consider the following steps:

**A. Use Geometric Mean Return**

- **Why**: Represents the actual compounded rate of growth over time.
- **Calculation**:

  $$
  G = \left( \prod_{i=1}^{N} (1 + R_i) \right)^\frac{1}{N} - 1
  $$

**B. Choose a Risk Measure Aligned with Geometric Returns**

- **Options**:
  - **Maximum Drawdown**: For metrics like the Calmar Ratio.
  - **Downside Deviation**: Focuses on negative returns affecting compounding.
  - **Standard Deviation of Log Returns**: Reflects variability in compounded returns.

**C. Develop an Adjusted Sharpe-like Ratio**

**Option 1: Geometric Sharpe Ratio Using Standard Deviation of Log Returns**

$$
\text{Geometric Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{G - R_f}{\sigma_{\ln}}
$$

- $$ \sigma_{\ln} $$: Standard deviation of log returns.
- **Justification**: Since geometric returns are linked to log returns, using $$ \sigma_{\ln} $$ provides consistency.

**Option 2: Geometric Sharpe Ratio Using Downside Deviation**

$$
\text{Geometric Sortino Ratio} = \frac{G - R_f}{\sigma_D}
$$

- $$ \sigma_D $$: Downside deviation.
- **Justification**: Emphasizes the impact of negative returns on compounding.

**Option 3: Geometric Sharpe Ratio Using Adjusted Volatility**

Adjust the volatility to account for skewness and kurtosis.

- **Adjusted Volatility ($$ \sigma_{\text{adj}} $$)**:

  $$
  \sigma_{\text{adj}} = \sigma \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma_3}{6} S + \frac{\gamma_4 - 3}{24} K \right)
  $$

  - $$ \gamma_3 $$: Skewness.
  - $$ \gamma_4 $$: Kurtosis.
  - $$ S, K $$: Sensitivity coefficients.

- **Then**:

  $$
  \text{Adjusted Geometric Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{G - R_f}{\sigma_{\text{adj}}}
  $$

- **Note**: Estimating $$ S $$ and $$ K $$ requires statistical analysis.

**D. Incorporate Theoretical Maximum Drawdown**

**Develop a Ratio Using Theoretical MDD**:

1. **Estimate Theoretical MDD** using adjusted geometric returns and variance.
2. **Calculate the Ratio**:

   $$
   \text{Adjusted Performance Ratio} = \frac{G - R_f}{\text{Theoretical MDD}}
   $$

**E. Consider the Impact of Skewness and Kurtosis**

- Recognize that negative skewness and high kurtosis can significantly impact geometric returns and the risk of large drawdowns.
- Adjust both the return and risk measures to account for these higher moments.

---

### **6. Practical Implementation**

**A. Data Requirements**

- Obtain sufficient historical return data to estimate:

  - Geometric mean return ($$ G $$).
  - Standard deviation of returns ($$ \sigma $$) and log returns ($$ \sigma_{\ln} $$).
  - Skewness ($$ \gamma_3 $$) and kurtosis ($$ \gamma_4 $$).
  - Maximum drawdown (historical and theoretical).

**B. Statistical Analysis**

- Use statistical software to calculate higher-order moments.
- Fit the return distribution to a skewed Student's t-distribution to capture the characteristics accurately.

**C. Interpretation**

- **Geometric Sharpe Ratio**:

  - Higher values indicate better risk-adjusted performance when considering compounding.
  - Allows for comparison between portfolios or strategies over multiple periods.

- **Calmar Ratio**:

  - Provides insight into the return achieved per unit of maximum drawdown risk.
  - Useful for evaluating strategies with different risk profiles.

---

### **7. Limitations and Considerations**

**A. Estimation Errors**

- Geometric returns and higher moments can be sensitive to outliers and estimation errors.
- Ensure robustness by using long time series data where possible.

**B. Time Horizon**

- The relevance of geometric returns increases with the investment horizon.
- Short-term evaluations may not reflect the benefits of compounding.

**C. Risk Preferences**

- Different investors may have varying sensitivities to risk measures.
- Some may prioritize avoiding large drawdowns over volatility.

**D. Model Assumptions**

- Ensure the chosen risk measures and return calculations align with the distributional assumptions of the returns.
- Be cautious when applying normal distribution-based risk measures to non-normal return distributions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The traditional Sharpe Ratio has limitations when assessing long-term investment performance, especially in the presence of high volatility, skewness, and kurtosis. By utilizing **geometric returns** and appropriately aligned risk measures, you can develop a performance metric that more accurately reflects the true risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio over time.

**Recommended Metric:**

- **Geometric Sharpe Ratio** using geometric mean return and a risk measure consistent with compounding effects, such as the standard deviation of log returns or maximum drawdown.

**Alternative Metric:**

- **Calmar Ratio**, which directly uses geometric returns and maximum drawdown.

By adopting these measures, you can:

- Align the performance metric with the **investor's experience** of returns and risk.
- Account for the **compounding effects** that impact long-term portfolio growth.
- Incorporate the **impact of higher-order moments** (skewness and kurtosis) on both returns and risk.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. **Calculate the Geometric Mean Return** of your portfolio over the relevant time horizon.
2. **Select an Appropriate Risk Measure**, considering maximum drawdown or adjusted volatility.
