# Volatility Estimation in Financial Time Series

## Introduction

Volatility estimation is a crucial aspect of financial modeling, risk management, and portfolio optimization. Accurately assessing the risk associated with asset returns enables better-informed investment decisions and more robust financial models. This document focuses on:

- The distinction between **arithmetic returns** and **log returns**.
- The use of volatility measures in different financial contexts, such as **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)** and **Black-Scholes**.
- Adjusting volatility to account for **higher moments** (skewness and kurtosis), particularly using the **skewed Student-t distribution**.
- Techniques for **volatility forecasting** using models like **GARCH** and **HAR**.
- Converting **log return volatility** back to **arithmetic return volatility** for use in MVO.
- Implementing formulas in **Python**, including covariance and correlation conversions.

This guide serves as a foundation for developing a Python library (FTS - Financial Time Series) that handles asset prices, returns, volatility estimation, correlations, statistical properties, and distribution fitting.

## Arithmetic vs. Log Returns

### Arithmetic Returns

- **Definition**: The simple percentage change in the value of an asset over a period.
  $$
  R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1
  $$
  
- **Properties**:
  - **Not Time-Additive**: Returns over multiple periods are not additive.
  - **Range**: Can theoretically range from $$-100\%$$ (complete loss) to $$+\infty$$ (unlimited gain).
  - **Application in MVO**: Used because expected portfolio return is a weighted sum of individual asset returns.

### Log Returns (Continuously Compounded Returns)

- **Definition**: The natural logarithm of the price relative.
  $$
  r_t = \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\right)
  $$
  
- **Properties**:
  - **Time-Additive**: Returns over multiple periods can be summed.
  - **Range**: Theoretically from $$-\infty$$ to $$+\infty$$.
  - **Statistical Advantages**: Often exhibit better statistical properties (e.g., normality) for modeling.
  - **Application in Black-Scholes and Volatility Forecasting Models**: Used due to the assumption of lognormally distributed prices.

## Volatility in Different Financial Contexts

### Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)

- **Objective**: Optimize the trade-off between expected return and risk (volatility).
- **Expected Returns**: Requires arithmetic returns to correctly represent expected portfolio growth.
- **Volatility Measure**: Traditionally uses the standard deviation of **arithmetic returns**.
- **Conversion Needed**: When working with log return volatility, convert it to arithmetic return volatility for consistency.

### Black-Scholes Model

- **Objective**: Price options based on the assumption that asset prices follow a geometric Brownian motion.
- **Returns Used**: Works with **log returns** due to the lognormal distribution assumption.
- **Volatility Measure**: Uses the standard deviation of **log returns**.

### Practical Approach

- **Forecasting Volatility**: Models like **GARCH** and **HAR** are designed for log returns.
- **Conversion**: Work with log return volatility for modeling and forecasting, then convert it back to arithmetic return volatility for use in MVO.

## Adjusting Volatility for Higher Moments

### Importance of Higher Moments

- **Skewness ($$\gamma_3$$)**: Measures asymmetry in the return distribution.
- **Excess Kurtosis ($$\gamma_4 - 3$$)**: Measures the "tailedness" relative to a normal distribution.
- **Impact on Risk**: Standard deviation alone may not capture risks from asymmetry and fat tails.

### Adjusting Volatility with Skewed Student-t Distribution Parameters

#### Skewed Student-t Distribution

- **Parameters**:
  - **Volatility ($$\sigma$$)**: Scale parameter.
  - **Degrees of Freedom ($$\nu$$)**: Related to kurtosis; controls tail heaviness.
  - **Skewness Parameter ($$\lambda$$)**: Controls asymmetry in the distribution.

#### Calculating Moments

- **Variance ($$\sigma^2$$)**:
  $$
  \text{Var}[X] = \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{\nu}{\nu - 2}
  $$

- **Skewness ($$\gamma_3$$)**:
  $$
  \gamma_3 = \frac{2 \lambda \left( \nu (\lambda^2 + 3) - ( \lambda^2 + 3 ) \right)}{(\nu - 3)(1 + \lambda^2)^\frac{3}{2}}
  $$
  
- **Excess Kurtosis ($$\gamma_4 - 3$$)**:
  $$
  \gamma_4 - 3 = \frac{6 \left[ \nu^2 (\lambda^4 + 2\lambda^2 + 5 ) - 4\nu ( \lambda^4 + 5\lambda^2 + 5 ) + 3 ( \lambda^4 + 6\lambda^2 + 5 ) \right]}{(\nu - 4)(\nu - 3)(1 + \lambda^2)^2}
  $$
  
  **Note**: These formulas may vary depending on the parameterization of the skewed Student-t distribution.

#### Adjusted Volatility Formula

- **Adjusted Volatility**:
  $$
  \sigma_{\text{adjusted}} = \sigma_{\text{std}} \left(1 + \alpha \gamma_3 + \beta (\gamma_4 - 3)\right)
  $$

  Where:
  
  - $$\sigma_{\text{std}}$$: Standard deviation calculated from the variance $$\text{Var}[X]$$.
  - $$\alpha$$, $$\beta$$: Weighting coefficients determined empirically or based on risk preferences.
  
#### Python Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def adjusted_volatility_skewed_student_t(sigma, nu, lambda_, alpha=1.0, beta=1.0):
    """
    Adjusts volatility using parameters of the skewed Student-t distribution.

    Parameters:
    - sigma: Scale parameter (volatility from distribution fitting).
    - nu: Degrees of freedom (> 4 for kurtosis to exist).
    - lambda_: Skewness parameter.
    - alpha: Weight for skewness adjustment (default 1.0).
    - beta: Weight for kurtosis adjustment (default 1.0).

    Returns:
    - Adjusted volatility.
    """
    if nu <= 4:
        raise ValueError("Degrees of freedom nu must be greater than 4 for skewness and kurtosis to exist.")
    
    # Calculate variance
    variance = sigma**2 * (nu / (nu - 2))
    std_dev = np.sqrt(variance)
    
    # Calculate skewness
    numerator_skew = 2 * lambda_ * (nu * (lambda_**2 + 3) - (lambda_**2 + 3))
    denominator_skew = (nu - 3) * (1 + lambda_**2)**1.5
    skewness = numerator_skew / denominator_skew
    
    # Calculate excess kurtosis
    numerator_kurt = 6 * (nu**2 * (lambda_**4 + 2 * lambda_**2 + 5) - 4 * nu * (lambda_**4 + 5 * lambda_**2 + 5) + 3 * (lambda_**4 + 6 * lambda_**2 + 5))
    denominator_kurt = (nu - 4) * (nu - 3) * (1 + lambda_**2)**2
    excess_kurtosis = numerator_kurt / denominator_kurt
    
    # Adjusted volatility
    sigma_adjusted = std_dev * (1 + alpha * skewness + beta * excess_kurtosis)
    return sigma_adjusted
```

**Usage Example**:

```python
# Estimated parameters from fitting the skewed Student-t distribution
sigma_est = 0.02    # Scale parameter (volatility)
nu_est = 10         # Degrees of freedom
lambda_est = -0.5   # Skewness parameter

# Adjusted volatility calculation
adjusted_vol = adjusted_volatility_skewed_student_t(sigma_est, nu_est, lambda_est)
print(f"Adjusted Volatility: {adjusted_vol:.6f}")
```

**Note**:

- Ensure that the estimated degrees of freedom $$\nu$$ is greater than 4 to calculate skewness and kurtosis.
- The formulas provided match a specific parameterization of the skewed Student-t distribution. Adjust them if using a different parameterization.

## Converting Log Return Volatility to Arithmetic Return Volatility

### Rationale

- **Consistency**: MVO requires arithmetic returns and volatility.
- **Accuracy**: Direct application of log return volatility in MVO can lead to misestimations, especially for assets with higher volatility or over longer time horizons.

### Conversion Formulas

#### Mean Conversion

- **From Log to Arithmetic Mean**:
  $$
  E[R] = e^{\mu + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2} - 1
  $$
  
  Where:
  
  - $$E[R]$$: Expected arithmetic return.
  - $$\mu$$: Mean of log returns.
  - $$\sigma^2$$: Variance of log returns.

#### Variance Conversion

- **From Log to Arithmetic Variance**:
  $$
  \text{Var}[R] = \left( e^{\sigma^2} - 1 \right) e^{2\mu + \sigma^2}
  $$
  
  Where:
  
  - $$\text{Var}[R]$$: Variance of arithmetic returns.

#### Covariance Conversion

For assets $$i$$ and $$j$$:

- **From Log to Arithmetic Covariance**:
  $$
  \text{Cov}[R_i, R_j] = e^{\mu_i + \mu_j + \frac{1}{2} (\sigma_i^2 + \sigma_j^2) + \sigma_{ij}} - \left( e^{\mu_i + \frac{1}{2} \sigma_i^2} - 1 \right) \left( e^{\mu_j + \frac{1}{2} \sigma_j^2} - 1 \right)
  $$

  Where:

  - $$\sigma_{ij}$$: Covariance of log returns between assets $$i$$ and $$j$$.

#### Correlation Conversion

The correlation between arithmetic returns:

- **Arithmetic Correlation**:
  $$
  \rho_{R_i, R_j} = \frac{ \text{Cov}[R_i, R_j] }{ \sigma_{R_i} \sigma_{R_j} }
  $$

  Where:

  - $$\sigma_{R_i}$$, $$\sigma_{R_j}$$: Standard deviations of arithmetic returns for assets $$i$$ and $$j$$.

### Working with Volatilities and Correlation Matrices

**Answer**

Your question is whether the volatility estimate (sigma) obtained from fitting a return series to a **skewed Student-t distribution** is different from the standard deviation calculated using standard methods (e.g., using Pandas). Specifically:

- **Is the sigma from the skewed Student-t distribution fitting the same as the sample standard deviation?**
- **Does the sigma estimate from the skewed Student-t distribution already incorporate skewness and degrees of freedom (kurtosis)?**
- **Do we need to adjust the volatility separately if we use the sigma from the skewed Student-t distribution?**

**Short Answer:**

- **The sigma parameter obtained from fitting a skewed Student-t distribution is generally different from the sample standard deviation calculated directly from the data.**
- **The sigma from the skewed Student-t distribution is a scale parameter that, in combination with the estimated skewness ($$\lambda$$) and degrees of freedom ($$\nu$$), determines the distribution's variance (and thus the volatility).**
- **Therefore, the sigma alone does not fully capture the impact of skewness and kurtosis on volatility. To obtain the true volatility (standard deviation) of the fitted distribution, you need to calculate it using all three parameters ($$\sigma$$, $$\nu$$, $$\lambda$$).**
- **Once you compute the standard deviation (volatility) from the fitted distribution using these parameters, you do not need to adjust the volatility separately for skewness and kurtosis—it already reflects these higher moments.**

---

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. **Standard Deviation from Pandas vs. Sigma from Skewed Student-t Fitting**

#### **Standard Deviation from Pandas or Similar Libraries**

- **Definition**: The sample standard deviation is calculated directly from the data without assuming any underlying distribution.
  $$
  \sigma_{\text{sample}} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 }
  $$
- **Assumptions**: It is a descriptive statistic and does not inherently assume that the data follows a normal distribution, although the interpretation often relates to normality.
- **Characteristics**: Reflects the dispersion of data around the mean but does not account for skewness or kurtosis explicitly.

#### **Sigma from Skewed Student-t Distribution Fitting**

- **Definition**: The sigma ($$\sigma$$) parameter in the skewed Student-t distribution is a **scale parameter** of the distribution.
- **Fitting Process**: When fitting a skewed Student-t distribution (e.g., using maximum likelihood estimation), you estimate parameters that best explain the data under the assumption that it follows this distribution.
- **Components**: The skewed Student-t distribution has parameters:
  - **Location ($$\mu$$)**: The central tendency (mean).
  - **Scale ($$\sigma$$)**: The scale of the distribution (analogous to volatility).
  - **Degrees of Freedom ($$\nu$$)**: Controls the tails (kurtosis).
  - **Skewness Parameter ($$\lambda$$)**: Controls the asymmetry (skewness).

#### **Difference Between the Two**

- **Not Directly Comparable**: The sigma from the skewed Student-t distribution is not the same as the sample standard deviation ($$\sigma_{\text{sample}}$$).
- **Adjustments for Higher Moments**: The actual variance (and thus the standard deviation) of the skewed Student-t distribution depends on $$\sigma$$, $$\nu$$, and $$\lambda$$—not on $$\sigma$$ alone.

### 2. **Does Sigma from Skewed Student-t Incorporate Skewness and Kurtosis?**

#### **Role of Sigma in the Distribution**

- **Scale Parameter**: Sigma ($$\sigma$$) scales the distribution but does not fully represent volatility on its own.
- **Influence of Skewness and Kurtosis**: The distribution's skewness and kurtosis (controlled by $$\lambda$$ and $$\nu$$) affect the variance and higher moments.

#### **Calculating Variance of the Skewed Student-t Distribution**

- **Variance Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Var}[X] = \sigma^2 \cdot \left( \frac{\nu}{\nu - 2} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1 + 3\lambda^2}{1 + \lambda^2} \right)
  $$
  - This formula shows that variance depends on:
    - Scale parameter ($$\sigma$$).
    - Degrees of freedom ($$\nu$$)—affects kurtosis.
    - Skewness parameter ($$\lambda$$)—affects skewness and contributes to variance.

- **Interpretation**: The variance (and hence volatility) of the skewed Student-t distribution is **not solely determined by $$\sigma$$** but is **a function of $$\sigma$$, $$\nu$$, and $$\lambda$$**.

#### **Sample Standard Deviation vs. Fitted Distribution Variance**

- **Sample Standard Deviation**: Calculated directly from the data, capturing the observed dispersion but not modeled in the context of a specific distribution.
- **Fitted Distribution Variance**: Calculated using the estimated parameters that account for skewness and kurtosis, providing a theoretical variance under the assumed distribution.

### 3. **Do We Need to Adjust Volatility Separately?**

#### **When Using Fitted Distribution Parameters**

- **Adjustments Within the Distribution**: Since the variance of the skewed Student-t distribution already incorporates skewness and kurtosis through $$\nu$$ and $$\lambda$$, calculating the standard deviation from the fitted distribution provides a volatility measure that accounts for higher moments.

- **No Separate Adjustment Needed**: If you calculate the volatility (standard deviation) using all the distribution's parameters:
  $$
  \sigma_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{ \text{Var}[X] }
  $$
  Then, you do not need to adjust this volatility separately for skewness and kurtosis—it already reflects these aspects.

#### **If Using Sigma Alone**

- **Incomplete Picture**: If you only use the sigma ($$\sigma$$) parameter from the skewed Student-t distribution without considering $$\nu$$ and $$\lambda$$, you **do not** fully capture the impact of skewness and kurtosis on volatility.

- **Need for Adjustment**: In this case, you would need to adjust the volatility estimate to account for the higher moments, similar to the adjustment formula discussed earlier:
  $$
  \sigma_{\text{adjusted}} = \sigma \left(1 + \alpha \gamma_3 + \beta (\gamma_4 - 3)\right)
  $$

### 4. **Practical Implications for Your Implementation**

#### **Fitting the Skewed Student-t Distribution**

- **Estimation**: When you fit the skewed Student-t distribution to your return series using a library like `statsmodels`, you obtain estimates for all parameters: $$\mu$$, $$\sigma$$, $$\nu$$, and $$\lambda$$.

#### **Calculating Volatility**

- **Compute Variance Using All Parameters**:
  - Use the variance formula specific to the skewed Student-t distribution as shown above.
  - Example:
    $$
    \text{Var}[X] = \sigma^2 \cdot \left( \frac{\nu}{\nu - 2} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1 + 3\lambda^2}{1 + \lambda^2} \right)
    $$
- **Calculate Standard Deviation**:
  - Then, calculate the standard deviation (volatility):
    $$
    \sigma_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{ \text{Var}[X] }
    $$
- **No Separate Adjustment Needed**: This standard deviation already accounts for skewness and kurtosis inherent in the distribution.

#### **Using the Estimated Volatility in MVO**

- **Consistency**: Use the calculated standard deviation ($$\sigma_{\text{total}}$$) as your volatility input in Mean-Variance Optimization.
- **No Further Adjustments**: Since this volatility measure incorporates the effects of skewness and kurtosis, you do not need to apply additional adjustments.

---

## Example Calculation

Suppose you have estimated the following parameters from fitting the skewed Student-t distribution:

- **Sigma ($$\sigma$$)**: 0.02
- **Degrees of Freedom ($$\nu$$)**: 10
- **Skewness Parameter ($$\lambda$$)**: -0.5

### Step 1: Calculate Variance Using the Distribution Parameters

$$
\text{Var}[X] = \sigma^2 \cdot \left( \frac{\nu}{\nu - 2} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1 + 3\lambda^2}{1 + \lambda^2} \right)
$$

Plugging in the values:

1. Compute $$\frac{\nu}{\nu - 2}$$:

   $$
   \frac{10}{10 - 2} = \frac{10}{8} = 1.25
   $$

2. Compute $$\frac{1 + 3\lambda^2}{1 + \lambda^2}$$:

   $$
   \lambda^2 = (-0.5)^2 = 0.25
   $$

   $$
   \frac{1 + 3 \times 0.25}{1 + 0.25} = \frac{1 + 0.75}{1.25} = \frac{1.75}{1.25} = 1.4
   $$

3. Compute $$\text{Var}[X]$$:

   $$
   \text{Var}[X] = (0.02)^2 \times 1.25 \times 1.4 = 0.0004 \times 1.75 = 0.0007
   $$

### Step 2: Calculate Standard Deviation

$$
\sigma_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{ \text{Var}[X] } = \sqrt{0.0007} \approx 0.0265
$$

### Interpretation

- **Volatility ($$\sigma_{\text{total}}$$)**: Approximately 2.65%, which is higher than the sigma parameter ($$\sigma = 2\%$$) due to adjustments for skewness and kurtosis.
- **Already Adjusted**: This volatility measure incorporates the effects of skewness ($$\lambda$$) and kurtosis ($$\nu$$).

---

## Conclusion

- **Sigma vs. Standard Deviation**: The sigma ($$\sigma$$) parameter from the skewed Student-t distribution fitting is not the same as the sample standard deviation calculated directly from the data.
- **Incorporation of Higher Moments**: The standard deviation calculated from the fitted distribution's parameters ($$\sigma$$, $$\nu$$, $$\lambda$$) accounts for skewness and kurtosis.
- **No Additional Adjustment Needed**: Once you compute the volatility (standard deviation) using all the distribution parameters, you do not need to adjust it separately for skewness and kurtosis.
- **Recommended Practice**:
  - **Calculate Variance and Volatility**: Use the appropriate formulas to compute the variance and standard deviation from the fitted distribution.
  - **Ensure Consistency**: Use this calculated volatility in your models to reflect the true risk, considering higher moments.

## Python Implementation

Here's how you might implement this calculation in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_volatility_skewed_student_t(sigma, nu, lambda_):
    """
    Calculates the standard deviation (volatility) of the skewed Student-t distribution.

    Parameters:
    - sigma: Scale parameter (from distribution fitting).
    - nu: Degrees of freedom (nu > 2 for variance to exist).
    - lambda_: Skewness parameter.

    Returns:
    - Volatility (standard deviation) that incorporates skewness and kurtosis.
    """
    if nu <= 2:
        raise ValueError("Degrees of freedom nu must be greater than 2 for variance to exist.")
    
    # Calculate variance components
    variance = sigma**2 * (nu / (nu - 2)) * ((1 + 3 * lambda_**2) / (1 + lambda_**2))
    std_dev = np.sqrt(variance)
    return std_dev

# Example usage
sigma_est = 0.02    # Scale parameter from fitting
nu_est = 10         # Estimated degrees of freedom
lambda_est = -0.5   # Estimated skewness parameter

volatility = calculate_volatility_skewed_student_t(sigma_est, nu_est, lambda_est)
print(f"Calculated Volatility: {volatility:.6f}")
```

**Output:**

```
Calculated Volatility: 0.026458
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Parameter Estimation**: When fitting a skewed Student-t distribution, you obtain all necessary parameters to calculate the distribution's variance and standard deviation.
- **Comprehensive Volatility Measure**: The calculated standard deviation using all parameters reflects the true volatility, accounting for skewness and kurtosis.
- **No Further Adjustment Required**: Using this volatility measure, you do not need to apply additional adjustments for skewness and kurtosis.

---

## Additional Considerations

- **Sample Size and Estimation Accuracy**: Ensure that your data sample is sufficiently large to obtain reliable estimates of the distribution parameters.
- **Assumption Validity**: Verify that the skewed Student-t distribution is an appropriate model for your data. If the fit is poor, the calculated volatility may not accurately reflect the true risk.
- **Alternative Measures**: If you prefer or require the use of standard deviation calculated directly from the data, you might consider adjusting it for skewness and kurtosis using adjustment formulas.
- **Consistency in Models**: When applying this volatility in models like Mean-Variance Optimization, ensure that all inputs are consistent and based on compatible assumptions.
