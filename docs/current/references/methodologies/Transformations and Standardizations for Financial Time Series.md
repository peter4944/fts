# Transformations and Standardizations for Financial Time Series

## 1. Introduction: Transforming Financial Time Series for Analysis

Financial time series data often require careful pre-processing before they can be effectively used in modeling, forecasting, or risk management. Raw price series, while fundamental, are often not directly suitable for analysis due to their non-stationarity and often erratic behavior. Instead, we focus on transformations, such as computing returns, and subsequently standardizing these series. These transformations create more well-behaved series which helps make statistical analysis more reliable. 

This note focuses on common methods for transforming and standardizing financial time series, particularly return series, excess return series, and volatility. These transformations aim to address key challenges such as skewness, non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity), and the presence of outliers in raw returns or other measures such as volatility. We will explore popular methods including Z-score standardization, min-max scaling, and Box-Cox transformations. 

A key distinction is made between the transformation of individual time series, such as standardizing a given stock's daily returns, and the whitening transformation. Whitening is a multivariate operation that deals with the covariance between multiple time series, to generate a set of new series that are uncorrelated. Whitening is typically applied to portfolios of assets.

The transformations described in this document are expected to be part of a larger financial time series library. Therefore, particular attention will be given to efficient implementation using vectorized operations, that is, processing many time series at once. This efficiency is critical for practical application and scalability.

Finally, we will cover the specific case of standardizing excess returns (the returns above a certain benchmark) and alpha (a measure of risk adjusted returns). These measures are critical in assessing performance in the asset management business.

## 2. Z-Score Standardization

Z-score standardization (also known as standard scaling or normalization) transforms a time series by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This results in a series with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is a widely used technique that makes series comparable by scaling their respective means and spreads to the same reference values.

**Mathematical Definition:**

For a time series *x*, the standardized series *z* is calculated as follows:

```
z_i = (x_i - μ) / σ
```

where:

*   *x\_i* represents an individual data point in the original time series.
*   *μ* is the mean of the time series *x*.
*   *σ* is the standard deviation of the time series *x*.

**Use Cases and Limitations:**

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Useful when you want to compare time series that have different scales and units, as it scales all of them to the same mean (zero) and spread (one standard deviation).
    *   Commonly used as a pre-processing step in machine learning models, particularly for methods that rely on distance calculation or gradient descent.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Assumes that the data is reasonably normally distributed. If data is heavily skewed the result may still look skewed.
    *   Sensitive to outliers, which can greatly influence both the mean and the standard deviation and therefore affect the standardization.

## 2. Standardization of Excess Returns and Alpha

In financial analysis, it is often more relevant to look at returns relative to a benchmark rather than absolute returns. Two common measures for this are excess returns and alpha. Standardizing these measures can provide valuable insights.

### 2.1 Excess Returns

Excess return is the return of an asset or portfolio minus the return of a benchmark. The benchmark can be the risk-free rate, a market index, or another relevant benchmark. This is typically computed per period.

**Mathematical Definition:**

For an asset's return time series *r_asset* and a benchmark's return time series *r_benchmark*, the excess return series *r_excess* is calculated as follows:

```
r_excess_i = r_asset_i - r_benchmark_i
```

where:

*   *r_asset\_i* represents the return of the asset at time *i*.
*   *r_benchmark\_i* represents the return of the benchmark at time *i*.

**Standardization of Excess Returns:**

Once the excess returns have been computed, they can be standardized using the Z-score method (as explained in the previous section). This helps to:

*   Compare the risk-adjusted performance of different assets, which may have different scales and volatilities.
*   Analyze how many standard deviations an asset's excess return deviates from its mean, to assess unusual performance.
*   Improve the input to machine learning models that learn by minimizing errors.

### 2.2 Alpha

Alpha is a measure of a portfolio's excess return relative to its expected return. It can be considered as a measure of the "skill" of the portfolio manager. A positive alpha implies that the portfolio outperformed its benchmark, while a negative alpha means it underperformed.

**Mathematical Definition**

Alpha is typically calculated as the intercept in a linear regression model. For instance, if we perform a regression of the asset's returns over the benchmark returns, the alpha would be the intercept. The regression equation would take the form:

```
r_asset_i = α + β * r_benchmark_i + ε_i
```

where:
*   *r_asset_i* represents the return of the asset at time *i*.
*   *r_benchmark_i* represents the return of the benchmark at time *i*.
*   *α* represents the alpha, which is the intercept in the model.
*   *β* represents the beta, which is the slope in the model
*   *ε_i* represents the error term at time *i*.

**Standardization of Alpha**

Similar to excess returns, once an alpha series is estimated it can be standardized using the Z-score method to:

*   Compare the skill of different managers on the same scale.
*   Analyze time series of alpha for regime changes or persistent performance.
*   Provide better input to machine learning algorithms.

**Key Points**

*   Both excess returns and alpha are calculated *before* standardization.
*   The Z-score standardization can then be applied to the resulting time series of excess returns and/or alphas.
*   Standardization helps in comparing different asset managers and/or different assets.


## 3. Box-Cox Transformation

The Box-Cox transformation is a family of power transformations that aims to make a time series more normally distributed and stabilize its variance. The transformation is parametrized by a value lambda, commonly denoted as λ. It is a useful technique when dealing with data that is not normally distributed, and it is especially useful for variables that are positively skewed. Unlike Z-Score and min-max scaling, the Box-Cox transformation does not simply rescale the series, but it non-linearly transforms it according to the parameter λ.

**Mathematical Definition:**

For a time series *x* where all *x\_i* values are positive (x > 0), the Box-Cox transformed series *y* is given by:

```
y_i = (x_i^λ - 1) / λ  if  λ ≠ 0
y_i = ln(x_i)        if  λ = 0
```

where:

*   *x\_i* represents an individual data point in the original time series.
*   *λ* (lambda) is the transformation parameter.

**Estimating Lambda (λ):**

The optimal value of λ is typically determined using maximum likelihood estimation. The `scipy.stats.boxcox` function performs this estimation automatically.

**Use Cases and Limitations:**

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Volatility Transformation:** Box-Cox is particularly useful for transforming volatility measures (e.g., realized volatility, GARCH-implied volatility) which are always positive, and tend to be skewed, as well as having variances that depends on the mean. It can help to stabilize variance, which can improve model fitting.
    *   **Other Positive Measures:** It can be useful when transforming other measures that are always positive (e.g., trading volume, option prices).
    *    **Regression Modeling:** It can help the data better fit the assumptions of linear regression models, potentially improving prediction performance.
    *   **When Data is Positively Skewed** When time series exhibit positive skew, Box-Cox may help reduce this skewness, making the transformed data more symmetrical and suitable for methods that assume normality.
    *   **Variance Stabilization:** Useful when a series has a variance that depends on its mean. For instance, a time series representing the daily range of returns may have this property.
    *    **Rolling Correlations** Box Cox can also be applied to rolling correlations, which take values between -1 and 1 and therefore need to be shifted to be positive.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Positivity Requirement:** Requires all data points to be strictly positive. This means that it cannot be directly applied to financial returns which can be negative.
    *   **May not always improve model performance**: There is no guarantee that the transformation will improve predictive performance.
    *   **Interpretation of the Transformed Data**: The interpretation of the data after applying the transformation is not so straightforward.
    *   **Reversibility:** Requires an additional step to be reversed, which may have numerical stability issues.

**Rolling Correlations**
As mentioned in the use-cases, Box-Cox can be applied to rolling correlations if the user finds it useful. Rolling correlations typically take values between -1 and 1, which means they must be shifted to be positive before the Box-Cox transformation can be applied.

**Note:**
As we move forward, we will see that the Box-Cox is an outlier amongst the standardization techniques that we have presented. Most techniques standardise the data by shifting and re-scaling the data, whereas the box-cox transformation introduces a non-linear function to the original data, which is parametrized by parameter λ.


## 4. Min-Max Scaling

Min-Max scaling (also known as normalization) transforms a time series to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This scaling method is often used to make each time series bounded between a certain range.

**Mathematical Definition:**

For a time series *x*, the min-max scaled series *x_scaled* is calculated as:

```
x_scaled_i = (x_i - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
```

where:

*   *x\_i* represents an individual data point in the original time series.
*   `min(x)` is the minimum value in the time series *x*.
*   `max(x)` is the maximum value in the time series *x*.

**Use Cases and Limitations:**

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Useful when dealing with data that have a natural upper and lower bound. For instance, when dealing with percentages, or probabilities.
    *   Helpful when used as a pre-processing step in algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of the input values, such as neural networks.
    *   Sometimes used when the user has a specific range for the data that is desired for modelling.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Sensitive to outliers, which can disproportionately influence the min and max values, causing the majority of values to be compressed into a narrow range.
    *   The transformation may not improve the data if it is not bounded and the data distribution is skewed.
    *   Does not change the data distribution, merely scales the series, meaning the output can still be skewed or have a non-constant variance if that is present in the original series.


## 5. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)

Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) is a self-supervised learning technique often used in the context of sequence data. Unlike the previous methods, CPC does not aim to standardize data in a particular manner, but is an approach to represent temporal dependencies, which can then be used for further modeling, for instance with neural networks. In its typical setting it consists of predicting the future of a series based on its past. It contrasts positive samples (future data points) against negative samples (random data points) using a contrastive loss function. The model will learn to maximize the mutual information between future and past.

**How It Works:**

1.  **Encoder:** The input time series is encoded using an encoder function, which maps the data to a lower-dimensional representation.
2.  **Context Vector:** The encoded data is aggregated into a context vector, capturing the temporal information in the series.
3.  **Prediction:** A predictor function learns to predict future values based on the context vector.
4.  **Contrastive Loss:** A contrastive loss is used to encourage the model to distinguish between the actual future data and randomly sampled (negative) data.

**Use Cases and Considerations:**

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Time Series Representation Learning:** CPC can learn representations of time series that capture temporal dependencies, which can then be used as inputs to models.
    *   **Feature Learning for Neural Networks:** CPC is often used in neural networks to pre-train models for time series analysis, allowing for more efficient training.

*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Computationally Intensive**: The direct implementation of CPC can be complex and computationally demanding, especially for large datasets.
    *   **Parameter Tuning:** CPC has several parameters that can affect the model's ability to learn meaningful representations. These parameters may need to be tuned for the specific task.
    *    **Not a Standardization** As opposed to Z-score, Min-Max, and Box-Cox transformations, CPC's primary goal is to learn time series representations, rather than standardizing the data to a particular scale.

## 6. Rank-Based Transformations

Rank-based transformations convert numerical data to their ordinal ranking or cumulative probability in the series. These methods are useful in cases where the data is highly skewed, or there are many outliers. Rank-based transformations are non-linear transformations, which help mitigate the impact of very large or very small numbers in a series.

**Types of Rank-Based Transformations**

*   **Rank Normalization:** Replaces the original data with its rank within the series. The lowest value is assigned rank 1, the second lowest rank 2, and so on.
*   **Gaussian Rank Transformation (also known as Rank Normalization with Gaussianization):** Rank normalization is followed by a transformation that ensures that the series follows a standard gaussian distribution. The procedure is as follows:
    1. Rank the data.
    2. Scale the ranks to be between 0 and 1, through division by the total number of observations.
    3. Map the scaled ranks to a gaussian distribution using the inverse CDF.
    This transformation aims to make the series more gaussian.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Let *x* denote the original time series, with elements *x<sub>i</sub>*.

*   **Rank Transformation:**
    * *rank<sub>i</sub>* denotes the rank of *x<sub>i</sub>*
*   **Gaussian Rank Transformation:**
    * Let *N* be the length of the series
    * The scaled rank is then given by: *scaledRank<sub>i</sub> = rank<sub>i</sub> / N*
    * The transformed value is then given by *y<sub>i</sub> = Φ<sup>-1</sup>(scaledRank<sub>i</sub>)*, where *Φ<sup>-1</sup>* is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

**Use Cases and Limitations**

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Dealing with Skewed Data:** Rank transformations are helpful in dealing with time series that exhibit a strong skew, as they distribute values more evenly by their relative rank.
    *   **Reducing the effect of Outliers:** These transformations help in cases where there are many outliers that would negatively impact the application of other methods.
    *   **Non-Linearity**: Rank-based methods introduce non-linearities to the data, allowing for non-linear modelling.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Loss of Information:** Rank-based methods discard the original value of the data. The transformed value is only meaningful in the context of all values.
    *  **Not a Standardization:** Similarly to CPC, it does not perform standardization but provides a transformation that can be used for further modelling.

## 7. Winsorization

Winsorization is a statistical method for dealing with outliers by limiting extreme values in the series. Instead of removing outliers, Winsorization replaces them with the next most extreme value. For example, in a 90% Winsorization the top 5% of values are set to the 95th percentile, and the bottom 5% of values are set to the 5th percentile.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
Let *x* be the original time series.
Let the Winsorization percentage be denoted by *p*.
*   Let *x<sub>p_lower</sub>* denote the *p/2* percentile of the data
*   Let *x<sub>p_upper</sub>* denote the *1-p/2* percentile of the data

The Winsorized data is calculated by:
```
x_winsorized_i =  x_i,              if x_{p_lower} <= x_i <= x_{p_upper}
x_winsorized_i = x_{p_lower},         if x_i < x_{p_lower}
x_winsorized_i = x_{p_upper}          if x_i > x_{p_upper}
```

**Use Cases and Limitations**

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Outlier Reduction:** Helps to reduce the effect of outliers, leading to more robust statistical analysis and modelling.
    *   **Robust Modeling**: Robust modelling may be better suited when outliers are present, and Winsorization can be used to reduce the impact of outliers in these models.
*   **Limitations:**
    *  **Information Loss:** Truncating the data at certain percentiles will make some information lost.
    *   **Parameter Choice:** The winsorization parameter is a hyperparameter, and care must be taken when choosing its value.
    *   **Not a Standardization:** Similarly to rank transformation and CPC, Winsorization doesn't directly standardize, but modifies the data by limiting extreme values.


## 8. Whitening Transformation

The whitening transformation is a multivariate technique that aims to decorrelate the components of a multivariate time series and scale their variances to one. Unlike the standardization methods we've seen so far, which operate on individual time series, whitening operates on a *set* of time series simultaneously. This technique is critical when one needs to apply models which rely on data being uncorrelated (e.g. PCA).

**Covariance Matrix**

Before explaining the whitening transformation, let's introduce the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix captures the relationships (variances and correlations) between different time series in a dataset.

Given *n* time series,  *x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>*, the covariance matrix, typically denoted as Σ, is an *n x n* matrix where:

*   The element at row *i* and column *i* represents the variance of time series *x<sub>i</sub>*.
*   The element at row *i* and column *j* (where *i* ≠ *j*) represents the covariance between time series *x<sub>i</sub>* and *x<sub>j</sub>*.
*   Covariance, divided by product of standard deviation of the two time series represents the correlation between the time series.
*   The covariance matrix is symmetric, which means that the element in the row *i* and column *j* is the same as the element in the row *j* and column *i*.

**Whitening Transformation Procedure**

The whitening transformation involves the following steps:

1.  **Estimate the Covariance Matrix:** Compute the covariance matrix (Σ) of the multivariate time series.
2.  **Compute the Inverse Square Root of the Covariance Matrix:**
    *   Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
    *   Calculate the inverse square root of the eigenvalues, and arrange them in a diagonal matrix.
    *   Compute the new covariance matrix with the inverse square root of the eigenvalues.
3.  **Transform the Data:** Multiply the original multivariate time series by the inverse square root matrix to obtain the whitened series.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Let **X** represent a matrix where each column corresponds to a time series, and the rows correspond to the time index. Let Σ denote the covariance matrix of the multivariate data. The whitening transformation is achieved by:

```
X_whitened = X * Σ^(-1/2)
```

Where Σ^(-1/2) is the inverse square root matrix of the covariance matrix. The series in *X_whitened* are uncorrelated and have unit variance.

**Use Cases and Limitations**

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Whitening is often a necessary pre-processing step before applying PCA, since PCA relies on data being uncorrelated to decompose data into uncorrelated principal components.
    *   **Independent Component Analysis (ICA):** Similarly to PCA, whitening is used for ICA algorithms that rely on independence of data.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** Whitened features can be used as input to other machine learning models, particularly if correlation is expected to have a negative impact in performance.

*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Computationally Expensive:** Computing the inverse square root of the covariance matrix can be computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional time series data.
    *   **Sensitive to Outliers:** The covariance matrix and therefore, the whitening transformation can be sensitive to outliers.
    *   **Loss of Information:** Whitening can sometimes remove relevant information by forcing decorrelation.
    *   **Stationarity Assumption:** The computation of the covariance matrix requires the time series to be stationary (covariance remains constant over time). This may not always be the case for financial data.
    *   **Requires Multiple Series:** Whitening cannot be applied to individual time series, it requires multiple series at a time.
    


## 9. Python Implementation

This section provides vectorized Python implementations for the transformations and standardizations discussed in this note. We will leverage `pandas` and `numpy` for efficient operations on time series data. Additionally, we will provide a helper function to generate histogram data, for both the original series, and the transformed series.

**Note on Log vs. Arithmetic Returns:**
When dealing with financial returns, it is important to distinguish between arithmetic returns and log returns. Arithmetic returns are defined as the percentage change in price, while log returns are defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the end price to the beginning price. Log returns are often preferred as they have some nice mathematical properties, such as being additive across time periods. However, some standardization methods may work better with either arithmetic or log returns, or may not be affected by the type of returns used. It is important to keep this in mind when applying transformations and standardizations.

## 10. When Not to Transform

While transformations and standardizations are powerful tools, it's important to recognize that they aren't always necessary or beneficial. Sometimes, the raw data, or a minimally transformed version, can be the best input for your analysis or model. Here are some considerations on when you may not want to transform or standardize your data.

**1. When the Original Scale Is Important:**

*   Some models rely on the absolute scale of the input features. For example, if you are building a model to predict prices directly, using log returns as the input may not be appropriate, as the model will be trained on data with completely different units.
*   If you need to interpret the coefficients of a model in the original units, you should avoid transformations or carefully handle them so that interpretations can be made.
*   Transformations can obscure the meaning of your data, particularly when interpreting the outputs of a model.

**2. When Data Is Already Well-Behaved:**

*   If your data is already normally distributed, or if it is not skewed, applying standardization methods such as Box-Cox may be unnecessary.
*   If the data does not exhibit heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), transformations like Box-Cox may not provide any benefit.
*  Applying methods such as Z-score or Min-Max scaling to data that is already on a comparable scale may be unnecessary.

**3. When Transformations Introduce Artefacts:**

*   Applying aggressive transformations like Box-Cox when they are not necessary may introduce unwanted artefacts.
*   Applying transformations such as whitening may result in loss of information if the relationship between the series is important for your model.

**4. When You Want to Focus on the Unaltered Data:**
* In some cases, you may want to analyze data exactly as it comes, without any modifications. For instance, if you want to study the impact of outliers.
* Sometimes it is useful to keep track of both the original and the transformed series so that the researcher has the flexibility to perform different types of analysis.

**5. Computational Cost:**

*   Some transformations, such as whitening, can be computationally expensive. If the performance gain is minimal, it may be better to avoid such transformations.
*   Rank-based transformations may be time-consuming for large datasets.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Experimentation:** Always try different transformations and assess their impact on your analysis or model. Some transformations may work better than others depending on your application.
*   **Visualization:** Visually inspect your data before and after transformations to confirm that the transformations are acting as expected.
*   **Model Performance:** Evaluate the model using the original and the transformed series, and select what is best suited for the analysis.
*   **Understand Your Data:** Have a good understanding of the underlying data and its properties, this may inform you about what to do with it.

In summary, it is critical to understand the benefits and limitations of each transformation technique, and apply them only when necessary, to avoid potentially unwanted issues. Sometimes it is better to keep the data as it is.

## 12. Conclusion

This note has provided an overview of various transformations and standardizations commonly used in financial time series analysis. We have covered methods for scaling individual series, such as Z-score standardization, Min-Max scaling, Box-Cox transformations, rank-based transformations, winsorization, and methods for handling multivariate series, such as the whitening transformation. We have also covered the important special case of excess returns and alpha. Additionally, we have provided a Python implementation section showing how to perform these operations in a vectorized way, along with a helper function that outputs histogram data.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Preprocessing is Essential:** Preprocessing financial time series data is a critical step before modeling or analysis. Raw price series are rarely directly suitable for modeling.
*   **Standardization for Comparisons:** Z-score standardization, min-max scaling and rank-based methods allow for comparison between different time series by rescaling the data to a similar range.
*   **Skew and Heteroscedasticity:** Methods such as Box-Cox are particularly useful when dealing with skewed data or data with heteroscedasticity, which are frequent in financial datasets.
*   **Outlier Handling:** Techniques such as Winsorization are important for robust modelling in the presence of extreme values in the data.
*   **Multivariate Relationships:** Whitening transformations are useful to decorrelate multivariate data, and are particularly useful when combined with other multivariate techniques such as PCA or ICA.
*   **Excess Returns and Alpha:** Standardizing excess returns and alpha helps in assessing the performance of assets or portfolios, and can help in comparing different investment options.
*   **Log Returns:** Log returns are often preferred in finance due to their desirable mathematical properties, and standardization and transformation methods can be applied to these types of returns.
*   **No One-Size-Fits-All:** There is no one-size-fits-all approach. The correct method depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis, which is why it is important to understand the properties of each transformation.
*   **When Not to Transform:** It is critical to understand the limitations of each method, and there are scenarios in which it is better not to transform the data.
*   **Experiment and Analyze:** Always experiment with different transformation methods and analyze their impact on your analysis or models. Visual inspection is an important tool to ensure that data transformations are working as expected.

**Final Thoughts:**

This document is intended to provide a practical guide to the implementation of standard transformations in financial time series data. These techniques are designed to be part of a wider financial time series library, and the design goal has been to implement these in a vectorized way using `pandas` and `numpy`. It is crucial to carefully assess the pros and cons of each method for your specific use case, as a deep understanding of the benefits and limitations of each technique can be critical in the modelling process.
