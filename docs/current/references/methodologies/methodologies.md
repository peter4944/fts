## Arithmetic to Geometric Returns: Theory and Applications

### 1. Introduction and Basic Concepts

#### 1.1 Overview

Converting arithmetic returns to geometric returns is essential for
understanding actual investment performance over time. This conversion
is particularly important because: - Real-world investment returns
compound over time - Return distributions are rarely perfectly normal -
Risk factors can have compounding negative effects - Portfolio
rebalancing and position sizing decisions depend on accurate return
estimates

#### 1.2 Key Definitions

##### Basic Return Measures

-   **Arithmetic Return ($R_a$)**: Simple average return over a period,
    calculated as the sum of returns divided by the number of periods
-   **Geometric Return ($R_g$)**: Return that accounts for compounding
    effects, representing the actual realized return over time
-   **Volatility ($\sigma$)**: Standard deviation of returns, measuring
    the dispersion of returns around their mean

##### Higher-Order Moments

-   **Skewness ($\gamma_3$)**: Measures asymmetry in the return
    distribution
    -   Positive skewness: More extreme positive returns than negative
    -   Negative skewness: More extreme negative returns than positive
    -   Zero skewness: Symmetric distribution
-   **Kurtosis ($\gamma_4$)**: Measures the thickness of distribution
    tails
    -   For a normal distribution, $\gamma_4 = 3$
    -   **Excess Kurtosis** = $\gamma_4 - 3$
    -   Higher kurtosis indicates more frequent extreme events
    -   Particularly important for risk management and option pricing

#### 1.3 Why Adjustments Matter

##### Volatility Drag

-   Returns don't compound linearly
-   Example: A +50% return followed by a -50% return results in a -25%
    total return
-   This effect, known as volatility drag, increases with higher
    volatility
-   Formula: $-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}$ represents the expected drag from
    volatility

##### Impact of Skewness

-   Negative skewness is particularly dangerous for leveraged portfolios
-   Common in financial markets (crashes occur more suddenly than
    rallies)
-   Requires higher risk premiums as compensation
-   Affects optimal position sizing and leverage decisions

##### Kurtosis Considerations

-   Fat tails mean extreme events happen more frequently than predicted
    by normal distribution
-   Critical for risk management and stress testing
-   Affects value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall calculations
-   More prominent in:
    -   High-frequency trading
    -   Options and derivatives
    -   Crisis periods
    -   Illiquid assets

### 2. Return Measures and Adjustments

#### 2.1 Return Components and Drag Effects

1.  **Arithmetic Return ($R_a$)**
    $$ R_a = \text{Simple average of returns} $$

2.  **Variance Drag** $$ \text{Variance Drag} = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} $$

3.  **Kurtosis Drag**
    $$ \text{Kurtosis Drag} = \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^4}{24} $$

4.  **Skewness Drag**
    $$ \text{Skew Drag} = \frac{\gamma_3\sigma^3}{6} $$

5.  **Return Progression**

    -   **Geometric Return**: $$ R_g = R_a - \text{Variance Drag} $$
    -   **Adjusted Geometric Return**:
        $$ R_{g,adj} = R_g - \text{Kurtosis Drag} - \text{Skew Drag} $$

#### 2.2 Volatility Adjustments

##### Under Normal Distribution

1.  **Standard Volatility ($\sigma$)**:
    -   Annualized log-return volatility
2.  **Adjusted Volatility ($\sigma_{adj}$)**:
    $$ \sigma_{adj} = \sigma\sqrt{1 + \frac{(\gamma_4 - 3)\sigma^2}{4} + \frac{\gamma_3^2\sigma^2}{6}} $$

##### Under Skewed Student-t Distribution

1.  **Student-t Volatility ($\sigma_t$)**:
    $$ \sigma_t = \sigma\sqrt{\frac{\nu}{\nu-2}} $$ Where $\nu$ is
    degrees of freedom

2.  **Skew-Adjusted Student-t Volatility ($\sigma_{t,adj}$)**:
    $$ \sigma_{t,adj} = \sigma_t(1 + \gamma_3\lambda) $$ Where $\lambda$
    is the market impact factor

### 3. Performance Metrics

#### 3.1 Sharpe Ratio Under Normal Distribution

1.  **Standard Sharpe Ratio**: $$ SR = \frac{R_a - R_f}{\sigma} $$

2.  **Geometric Sharpe Ratio**: $$ SR_g = \frac{R_g - R_f}{\sigma} $$

3.  **Adjusted Geometric Sharpe Ratio**:
    $$ SR_{g,adj} = \frac{R_{g,adj} - R_f}{\sigma_{adj}} $$

#### 3.2 Sharpe Ratio Under Student-t Distribution

1.  **Student-t Sharpe Ratio**:
    $$ SR_t = \frac{R_{g,adj} - R_f}{\sigma_t} $$

2.  **Skew-Adjusted Student-t Sharpe Ratio**:
    $$ SR_{t,adj} = \frac{R_{g,adj} - R_f}{\sigma_{t,adj}} $$

#### 3.3 Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio

$$ PSR(SR^*) = \Phi\left(\sqrt{n-1} \times \frac{SR - SR^*}{\sqrt{1 - \gamma_3 SR + \frac{(\gamma_4-1)}{4}SR^2}}\right) $$

Where: - $n$ is sample size - $SR^*$ is the threshold Sharpe ratio -
$\Phi$ is the cumulative normal distribution

#### 3.4 Deflated Sharpe Ratio

The Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR) accounts for multiple testing bias when
selecting strategies:

$$ DSR = PSR(SR_{\text{expected}}) $$

The expected maximum Sharpe ratio $(SR_{\text{expected}})$ after $T$
independent trials is:

$$ SR_{\text{expected}} = \sqrt{2\log(T)} - \frac{\log(\log(T)) + \log(4\pi)}{\sqrt{2\log(T)}} $$

Where $T$ represents: - Number of strategy variations tested - Number of
parameter combinations tried - Number of assets/portfolios evaluated -
Product of backtest length and rebalancing frequency

For example: - Testing 100 parameter combinations: $T = 100$ - Testing
10 strategies on 10 assets: $T = 100$ - Testing monthly rebalancing over
5 years: $T = 60$

### 4. Kelly Criterion and Position Sizing

#### 4.1 Under Normal Distribution

1.  **Basic Kelly Fraction**:
    $$ f^*_{\text{normal}} = SR = \frac{R_a - R_f}{\sigma} $$

2.  **Geometric Kelly Fraction**: $$ f^*_g = \frac{R_g - R_f}{\sigma} $$

3.  **Adjusted Geometric Kelly Fraction**:
    $$ f^*_{g,adj} = \frac{R_{g,adj} - R_f}{\sigma_{adj}} $$

#### 4.2 Under Student-t Distribution

1.  **Student-t Kelly Fraction**:
    $$ f^*_t = f^*_{g,adj} \times \frac{\nu-2}{\nu+1} $$

2.  **Skew-Adjusted Student-t Kelly Fraction**:
    $$ f^*_{t,adj} = f^*_t \times (1 - \gamma_3\lambda) $$

### 5. Maximum Theoretical Drawdown (MTD)

Assuming portfolio volatility is scaled to Kelly weight

#### 5.1 Under Normal Distribution

1.  **Basic MTD** (at full Kelly):
    $$ MTD_{\text{normal}} = \frac{\sigma}{2 \times SR} = 0.5 $$

2.  **Adjusted MTD**:
    $$ MTD_{adj} = \frac{\sigma_{adj}}{2 \times SR_{g,adj}} $$

#### 5.2 Under Student-t Distribution

1.  **Student-t MTD**:
    $$ MTD_t = MTD_{\text{normal}} \times \sqrt{\frac{\nu}{\nu-2}} $$

2.  **Skew-Adjusted Student-t MTD**:
    $$ MTD_{t,adj} = MTD_t \times (1 + \gamma_3\lambda) $$

#### 5.3 Partial Kelly Adjustments

For a fraction $k$ of full Kelly:
$$ MTD_{\text{partial}} = k \times MTD_{\text{full}} $$

### 6. Implementation Considerations

#### 6.1 Sample Size Requirements

-   Minimum samples needed for stable estimates
-   Impact of estimation error on each metric
-   Rolling window vs.Â expanding window estimates

#### 6.2 Distribution Testing

-   Tests for normality
-   Determination of degrees of freedom
-   Stability of higher moments

#### 6.3 Practical Constraints

-   Transaction costs
-   Market impact
-   Margin requirements
-   Leverage limits

## Backfilling Shorter Time-Series Data: A Practical Approach

### Introduction

A common challenge in portfolio analysis is dealing with assets that
have different lengths of historical data. For example, an emerging
market ETF might have returns dating back only to 2015, while developed
market indices have histories extending to the 1970s. The traditional
approach of truncating all series to match the shortest history discards
valuable information.

This note outlines a straightforward approach to backfilling shorter
time series using information from longer-history assets. The
methodology described here builds on academic work by Stambaugh (1997),
Page (2013), and Jiang & Martin (2016), but focuses on practical
implementation.

The key insights are:

1.  For basic backfilling, simple linear regression provides optimal
    estimates
2.  The uncertainty around these estimates can be directly characterized
    using regression residuals
3.  Complex simulation approaches, while theoretically interesting, are
    typically unnecessary for practical applications

### Mathematical Framework

#### Basic Backfilling Process

Consider two assets:

-   A long-history asset (e.g., S&P 500) with returns spanning 1970-2023
-   A short-history asset (e.g., Emerging Market ETF) with returns from
    2015-2023

The backfilling process involves three steps:

1.  **Establish Relationship**

    -   Use the overlapping period (2015-2023) to estimate how the
        short-history asset relates to the long-history asset
    -   This relationship is captured through ordinary least squares
        (OLS) regression

2.  **Generate Estimates**

    -   Apply the estimated relationship to the long-history asset's
        earlier data
    -   This provides our best estimate of what the short-history
        asset's returns would have been

3.  **Characterize Uncertainty**

    -   Use regression residuals to understand the uncertainty around
        our estimates
    -   These residuals tell us about volatility, skewness, and other
        distribution properties

#### Mathematical Details

The regression equation is:

    Short_Return = Î± + Î² Ã Long_Return + Îµ

Where:

-   Î± (alpha) represents the average excess return of the short-history
    asset
-   Î² (beta) captures the relationship between the two assets
-   Îµ (epsilon) represents the residual or unexplained portion of
    returns

For practitioners, key points to understand:

-   The regression automatically finds the best linear relationship
    between assets
-   Residuals capture how much the actual returns deviate from this
    relationship
-   The distribution of residuals tells us about the uncertainty in our
    estimates

### Core Algorithm and Implementation

#### The Two-Step Approach

##### Step 1: Generating Backfilled Values

The backfilling process is straightforward:

1.  **Perform Regression**

    -   Using the overlapping period where both return series exist
    -   For multiple explanatory assets, use multiple regression
    -   Standard regression diagnostics (RÂ², p-values) help assess
        relationship quality

2.  **Calculate Predicted Values**

    -   Apply regression coefficients to long-history returns
    -   These predictions become our backfilled values
    -   No need for complex adjustments or simulations

Example:

    Regression Period (2015-2023):
    EM_Return = 0.02 + 1.1 Ã SP500_Return

    Backfill (2010-2014):
    If SP500_Return in 2010 was 15%
    Then Backfilled_EM_2010 = 0.02 + 1.1 Ã 15% = 18.5%

##### Step 2: Characterizing Uncertainty

The regression residuals provide complete information about the
uncertainty in our backfilled values:

1.  **Distribution Properties**

    -   Standard deviation of residuals â volatility of estimates
    -   Skewness of residuals â tendency for extreme values
    -   Kurtosis of residuals â frequency of outliers

2.  **Practical Interpretation**

    -   Mean of residuals is zero (by construction)
    -   Standard deviation shows typical prediction error
    -   Higher moments capture non-normal behavior

Example:

    If regression residuals have:
    - Standard deviation = 3%
    - Skewness = -0.5
    - Kurtosis = 4.0

    Then our backfilled value of 18.5% for 2010:
    - Has Â±3% typical variation
    - Tends toward negative surprises
    - Has more extreme outcomes than normal

#### Implementation Considerations

##### Data Requirements

-   Minimum overlap period: prefer at least 24 months
-   Relationship stability: check for regime changes
-   Data quality: adjust for corporate actions, splits

##### Model Selection

1.  **Simple Cases**

    -   Single explanatory asset â standard OLS
    -   Stable relationships â no need for complexity

2.  **Complex Cases**

    -   Multiple explanatory assets â multiple regression
    -   Unstable relationships â consider rolling windows
    -   Non-linear relationships â consider transformations

##### Quality Control

1.  **Regression Diagnostics**

    -   RÂ² \> 0.3 suggests reasonable relationship
    -   Significant t-statistics for coefficients
    -   Well-behaved residuals (no patterns)

2.  **Economic Sense**

    -   Coefficients should be economically reasonable
    -   Direction and magnitude of relationship
    -   Consistency with market understanding

I'll outline the implementation structure for our backfill module,
focusing on core functionality while keeping it at an appropriate level
for a background note.

### Evolution of Backfilling Methodologies

The challenge of working with financial assets having different length
histories has long troubled portfolio managers and analysts. Should we
simply discard the longer histories to create an equal-length sample? Or
is there a way to use all available information? Over the past few
decades, three significant approaches have emerged to address this
problem, each building upon its predecessors while seeking greater
practical utility.

Robert Stambaugh first tackled this problem in his 1997 paper,
demonstrating that discarding longer histories wastes valuable
information. His insight was that longer histories of established
markets, like the S&P 500, contain useful information about newer
markets, such as emerging economy indices. Using maximum likelihood
estimation, Stambaugh developed a rigorous mathematical framework for
estimating the relationships between assets. While groundbreaking, his
approach assumed returns followed a normal distribution -- an assumption
we know often fails in financial markets.

Recognizing this limitation, SÃ©bastien Page introduced a more flexible
approach in 2013. Page's method preserved Stambaugh's insights but added
a simulation component to capture non-normal distributions. By
generating thousands of possible scenarios, his approach could better
reflect the fat tails and skewness common in financial returns. However,
this came at the cost of computational complexity and introduced new
questions: How many simulations are enough? How should we average
results across simulations?

In 2016, Jiang and Martin made a remarkable discovery. They showed that
the complexity of Page's simulation approach, while theoretically sound,
was unnecessary in practice. Their insight was simple but powerful: a
single set of regression residuals contains all the information we need
about the uncertainty in our estimates. Rather than generating multiple
scenarios, we can characterize the distribution of potential outcomes
directly from these residuals.

This progression brings us to a practical conclusion for today's
practitioners. For basic backfilling -- creating a synthetic history for
a shorter-history asset -- simple ordinary least squares regression
provides optimal estimates. The regression gives us our best estimate of
what returns would have been, while the residuals tell us about the
uncertainty in these estimates. We can directly compute volatility,
skewness, and other distributional properties from these residuals
without need for complex simulations.

Consider a portfolio manager needing to backfill emerging market returns
before 2015. Using the Jiang and Martin insight, they would: 1. Perform
a regression using the post-2015 overlap period 2. Use the regression to
generate pre-2015 estimates 3. Use the regression residuals to
characterize the uncertainty in these estimates

This approach provides the same information as more complex methods but
with greater clarity and simplicity. The residuals from a single
regression tell us everything we need to know about how much our
synthetic returns might deviate from their predicted values, whether
returns are likely to be skewed, and how often we might see extreme
values.

The elegance of this solution lies in its simplicity. While more complex
approaches might seem more sophisticated, Jiang and Martin proved that
simpler methods provide equivalent results. For practitioners, this
means we can focus on the economic logic of our backfilling choices --
which relationships we believe are stable and meaningful -- rather than
getting lost in computational complexity.

### Appendix A: Data Storage Implementation

#### BigQuery Schema Design for Synthetic Returns

The storage of synthetic return data presents unique challenges. We need
to maintain clear separation between actual and synthetic returns while
preserving all information necessary for reproducibility and analysis.
The schema design below leverages BigQuery's nested structure
capabilities to create an efficient and comprehensive storage solution.

##### Schema Structure

``` sql
CREATE TABLE synthetic_returns (
    ticker STRING,
    return_date DATE,
    return_value FLOAT64,
    model STRUCT<
        model_id STRING,
        analysis_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
        regression_stats STRUCT<
            r2 FLOAT64,
            residual_std FLOAT64,
            residual_skew FLOAT64,
            residual_kurt FLOAT64
        >,
        explanatory_series ARRAY<
            STRUCT<
                ticker STRING,
                coefficient FLOAT64,
                t_stat FLOAT64,
                p_value FLOAT64
            >
        >
    >
)
PARTITION BY return_date
CLUSTER BY ticker
```

This schema design offers several key advantages for practical
applications:

1.  **Data Segregation** By storing synthetic returns in a separate
    table from actual returns, we maintain data integrity while allowing
    easy identification of synthetic data. The model metadata stored
    alongside each return provides complete transparency about how the
    synthetic values were generated.

2.  **Reproducibility** The schema captures all necessary information to
    reproduce the synthetic returns:

-   Coefficients and statistics from the regression model
-   Identity of explanatory series used
-   Time stamp of when the analysis was performed
-   Complete statistical properties of the residuals

3.  **Query Efficiency** The schema leverages BigQuery's strengths
    through:

-   Partitioning by date for efficient time-series queries
-   Clustering by ticker for fast lookup of specific assets
-   Nested structures to keep related data together

##### Example Queries

Inserting synthetic returns with full model information:

``` sql
INSERT INTO synthetic_returns
SELECT
    'EMG.L' as ticker,
    return_date,
    return_value,
    STRUCT(
        'MODEL_20231204_001' as model_id,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() as analysis_timestamp,
        STRUCT(
            0.85 as r2,
            0.02 as residual_std,
            -0.3 as residual_skew,
            3.5 as residual_kurt
        ) as regression_stats,
        [
            STRUCT(
                'SPY' as ticker,
                1.1 as coefficient,
                15.5 as t_stat,
                0.001 as p_value
            ),
            STRUCT(
                'EFA' as ticker,
                0.4 as coefficient,
                5.2 as t_stat,
                0.01 as p_value
            )
        ] as explanatory_series
    ) as model
```

Retrieving synthetic returns with their model details:

``` sql
SELECT
    r.ticker,
    r.return_date,
    r.return_value,
    r.model.regression_stats.r2,
    exp.ticker as explanatory_ticker,
    exp.coefficient
FROM synthetic_returns r,
UNNEST(r.model.explanatory_series) as exp
WHERE r.ticker = 'EMG.L'
    AND r.return_date BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2015-12-31'
```

#### Implementation Considerations

When implementing this storage solution, consider:

1.  **Data Versioning** The model_id field can incorporate version
    information, allowing multiple versions of synthetic data to coexist
    for comparison and analysis.

2.  **Audit Trail** The analysis_timestamp field provides a crucial
    audit trail, helping track when synthetic data was generated and
    enabling investigation of any anomalies.

3.  **Storage Efficiency** The nested structure reduces redundancy while
    maintaining query efficiency, particularly important when storing
    synthetic data for many assets.

4.  **Data Governance** Clear separation of synthetic and actual returns
    supports data governance requirements and prevents accidental mixing
    of actual and synthetic data in analysis.

This storage design provides a robust foundation for managing synthetic
return data while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. The
schema can be extended as needed to accommodate additional metadata or
analysis requirements.

## Using DTW to Generate Financial Correlation Matrices

### 1. Introduction

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) offers a powerful alternative to traditional
correlation measures for financial time series analysis. While standard
correlation metrics assume contemporaneous relationships between assets,
DTW can detect similarities between time series even when they are out
of phase or exhibit non-linear relationships.

The key advantages of DTW for financial correlation estimation include:

-   Ability to handle asynchronous price movements
-   Detection of lagged relationships between assets
-   Robustness to non-linear relationships
-   Improved estimation of dependencies during market stress periods

### 2. Dynamic Time Warping Overview

DTW works by finding an optimal alignment between two time series by
warping the time dimension, while preserving essential shape
characteristics. Originally developed for speech recognition, DTW has
found wide application in financial markets where price movements often
exhibit complex temporal relationships.

Key references for the theoretical foundations:

-   Sakoe & Chiba (1978) for the original DTW algorithm
-   Tsinaslanidis & Kugiumtzis (2014) for financial applications
-   BankÃ³ & Abonyi (2012) for multivariate extensions

### 3. DTW Correlation Matrix Generation Process

#### Understanding Negative Correlations in DTW

DTW fundamentally measures similarity between time series, yielding a
distance/similarity measure between 0 and 1. However, financial
correlations range from -1 to +1, where:

-   +1 indicates perfect positive correlation
-   -1 indicates perfect negative correlation
-   0 indicates no correlation

The challenge is that DTW would see a perfectly negatively correlated
series as very dissimilar (high distance/low similarity), while in
finance, we need to identify both strong positive and negative
relationships. For example, if stock A goes up 1% while stock B goes
down 1% consistently, they have a strong negative correlation (-1) but
DTW would show them as dissimilar.

#### Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Parameters

``` python
def standardize_returns(returns):
    """
    Standardize returns to have mean=0 and std=1
    """
    return (returns - np.mean(returns)) / np.std(returns)

def get_default_window_size(frequency='daily'):
    """
    Get default DTW window size based on return frequency.
    Window sizes chosen to capture meaningful lead/lag relationships
    while avoiding spurious matches.
  
    Parameters:
    -----------
    frequency : str
        'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly'
  
    Returns:
    --------
    int : recommended window size for DTW calculation
    """
    window_sizes = {
        'daily': 20,    # Capture up to 1 month of trading lag
        'weekly': 8,    # Capture up to 2 months of trading lag
        'monthly': 3    # Capture up to 1 quarter of trading lag
    }
    return window_sizes.get(frequency, 20)  # Default to daily if not specified
```

#### Step 2: Calculate DTW Distances

For each pair of assets (A, B):

1.  Standardize both return series
2.  Calculate two DTW distances:
    -   Between A and B (captures positive correlation)
    -   Between A and -B (captures negative correlation)
    -   Take the minimum of these distances (highest similarity)

``` python
def calculate_dtw_similarity(series_a, series_b, frequency='daily', window_size=None):
    """
    Calculate DTW similarity between two standardized return series,
    checking both original and inverted relationships
  
    Parameters:
    -----------
    series_a, series_b : array-like
        Return series to compare
    frequency : str
        Data frequency for default window size
    window_size : int, optional
        Override default window size if specified
    """
    # Standardize both series
    std_a = standardize_returns(series_a)
    std_b = standardize_returns(series_b)
  
    # Set window size
    radius = window_size if window_size is not None else get_default_window_size(frequency)
  
    # Calculate DTW distance for both original and inverted series
    distance_original, _ = fastdtw(std_a, std_b, radius=radius)
    distance_inverse, _ = fastdtw(std_a, -std_b, radius=radius)
  
    # Convert distances to similarities (0 to 1 scale)
    sim_original = 1 - (distance_original / max(distance_original, distance_inverse))
    sim_inverse = 1 - (distance_inverse / max(distance_original, distance_inverse))
  
    return sim_original, sim_inverse
```

#### Step 3: Convert to Correlation Scale

Convert the similarity measures to correlations (-1 to +1 scale):

``` python
def convert_to_correlation(sim_original, sim_inverse):
    """
    Convert DTW similarities to correlation scale.
    Logic:
    - If inverse similarity is higher, series are negatively correlated
    - If original similarity is higher, series are positively correlated
    """
    if sim_inverse > sim_original:
        # Negative correlation case
        return -(2 * sim_inverse - 1)
    # Positive correlation case
    return 2 * sim_original - 1
```

#### Step 4: Build Complete Correlation Matrix

``` python
def build_dtw_correlation_matrix(returns_df):
    """
    Build full correlation matrix from returns dataframe
    """
    n_assets = returns_df.shape[1]
    corr_matrix = np.eye(n_assets)  # Initialize with 1s on diagonal
  
    for i in range(n_assets):
        for j in range(i+1, n_assets):
            # Get standardized returns for both assets
            series_i = returns_df.iloc[:, i]
            series_j = returns_df.iloc[:, j]
          
            # Calculate similarities
            sim_orig, sim_inv = calculate_dtw_similarity(series_i, series_j)
          
            # Convert to correlation
            correlation = convert_to_correlation(sim_orig, sim_inv)
          
            # Fill symmetric matrix
            corr_matrix[i, j] = correlation
            corr_matrix[j, i] = correlation
          
    return corr_matrix
```

#### Why Standardization Matters

Standardization of returns is crucial for DTW-based correlation
estimation for several reasons:

1.  **Scale Independence**: Assets with different volatilities can be
    compared fairly

    -   Example: A stock moving Â±5% daily vs one moving Â±0.5% daily
    -   Without standardization, the more volatile asset would dominate
        the DTW distance

2.  **Numerical Stability**: Standardization helps ensure:

    -   DTW algorithm converges more reliably
    -   Distance calculations are numerically stable
    -   Consistent results across different scales

3.  **Comparison Validity**: Makes DTW distances meaningful for:

    -   Cross-asset comparisons
    -   Different time periods
    -   Different market regimes

4.  **Improved Negative Correlation Detection**:

    -   Makes the comparison between original and inverted series more
        meaningful
    -   Ensures the magnitude of movements is comparable when checking
        for negative relationships

The standardization step should always be performed before DTW
calculation, not after, as it affects the path optimization within the
DTW algorithm itself.

## Handling Non-overlapping Data in Financial Time Series Analysis

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 The Missing Data Challenge in Financial Time Series

Financial time series frequently encounter missing or non-overlapping
data, presenting significant challenges for quantitative analysis, risk
management, and portfolio optimization. This issue is particularly acute
in daily and higher-frequency data, where market-specific factors create
systematic patterns of missing observations.

#### 1.2 Sources of Missing Data

##### Market Structure Factors

1.  **Different Trading Calendars**
    -   National holidays
    -   Religious observances
    -   Market-specific holidays
    -   Emergency closures
2.  **Time Zone Differences**
    -   Asynchronous trading hours
    -   Partial day overlaps
    -   Market open/close sequences
    -   Daylight saving time transitions
3.  **Market-Specific Events**
    -   Trading halts
    -   Circuit breakers
    -   Early market closes
    -   Technical disruptions
    -   Regulatory suspensions
4.  **Cross-Asset Considerations**
    -   Different asset class trading hours
    -   OTC vs.Â exchange trading
    -   Regional market differences
    -   ADR/underlying synchronization

#### 1.3 Impact on Financial Analysis

##### Statistical Implications

1.  **Correlation Estimation**
    -   Biased estimates from missing data
    -   Underestimation of co-movements
    -   Missing crucial market events
    -   Lead/lag relationship distortion
2.  **Risk Measures**
    -   Incomplete volatility capture
    -   Correlation matrix issues
    -   Systematic risk underestimation
    -   Spurious diversification effects
3.  **Portfolio Analytics**
    -   Optimization challenges
    -   Risk decomposition issues
    -   Performance attribution gaps
    -   Rebalancing timing problems

##### Practical Challenges

    Example: Global Equity Portfolio
    Time(UTC)   US     Japan  Germany  Action Required
    09:00       Closed Open   Open     Handle pre-US market
    16:00       Open   Closed Open     Update Japan with lag
    22:00       Closed Closed Closed   End-of-day alignment

#### 1.4 Frequency Dependence

The severity and nature of missing data problems vary significantly by
frequency:

  Frequency   Missing Data Prevalence   Primary Causes              Impact
  ----------- ------------------------- --------------------------- -------------
  Intraday    Very High                 Time zones, Trading hours   Critical
  Daily       High                      Holidays, Market closures   Significant
  Weekly      Low                       Extended market closures    Minor
  Monthly     Very Low                  Extreme events only         Minimal

#### 1.5 Example: Missing Data Impact

Consider a global portfolio during a Japanese holiday:

    Date        Japan   US      Europe
    2024-01-01  Holiday +1%     +0.8%
    2024-01-02  +1.5%   -0.2%   -0.1%

Traditional approaches might: 1. Discard 01-01 completely 2. Miss the
catch-up effect in Japanese markets 3. Underestimate correlations 4.
Miss risk transmission patterns

#### 1.6 The Need for Sophisticated Approaches

Simple solutions like: - Discarding incomplete observations - Basic
interpolation - Carrying forward last values

Are often inadequate because they: - Lose valuable information -
Introduce artificial patterns - Fail to capture market dynamics - Create
statistical biases

#### 1.7 Framework Requirements

An effective missing data handling framework must: 1. Preserve total
returns 2. Maintain statistical properties 3. Capture lead/lag
relationships 4. Support various analytical applications 5. Be
computationally feasible 6. Handle different data frequencies
appropriately

The following sections present four methodologies that address these
requirements in different ways, each with specific strengths for
particular use cases and data frequencies.

### 2. Methodologies

#### 2.1 Traditional All-Overlapping (Method 1)

**Description:** - Discard all time periods where any series has missing
data - Use only periods where all series have valid returns - Simplest
but most restrictive approach

**Example:**

    Time    X     Y     Z     Action
    t1      1%    1%    1%    Include
    t2      NaN   1%    1%    Discard entirely
    t3      2%    -1%   1%    Include

    Return vectors:
    X: [1%, 2%]
    Y: [1%, -1%]
    Z: [1%, 1%]

**Key Properties:** - Guarantees equal length series - Maintains matrix
properties - Maximum information loss - Fastest computation

#### 2.2 Synchronized Average (Method 2)

**Description:** - Keep all series synchronized - For missing periods,
distribute returns evenly across the gap - Preserves total price
movements while maintaining natural return variance

**Example:**

    Time    X     Y     Z        Action
    t1      1%    1%    NaN      Average Z's t2 return over t1,t2
    t2      2%    1%    2%       Average Z's t2 return over t1,t2
    t3      1%    1%    1%       Use directly

    Return vectors:
    X: [1%, 2%, 1%]
    Y: [1%, 1%, 1%]
    Z: [1%, 1%, 1%]    # t2's 2% return split evenly across t1,t2

**Key Properties:** - Maintains matrix properties - Better variance
representation than cumulative approach - Preserves total returns -
Natural return distribution

#### 2.3 Pairwise Overlapping (Method 3)

**Description:** - Consider each pair of series independently - Use only
overlapping periods for each pair - Different periods may be used for
different pairs

**Example:**

    Time    A     B     C     
    t1      1%    1%    NaN   
    t2      1%    NaN   1%    
    t3      1%    1%    1%    

    Pairwise vectors:
    A-B: A[t1,t3], B[t1,t3]
    A-C: A[t2,t3], C[t2,t3]
    B-C: B[t3], C[t3]

    Return vectors for A-B:
    A: [1%, 1%]
    B: [1%, 1%]

**Key Properties:** - More observations than Method 1 - Different
effective periods for each pair - May produce non-PSD correlation
matrix - Higher computational requirements

#### 2.4 Pairwise Average (Method 4)

**Description:** - Consider each pair independently - For gaps,
distribute returns evenly across missing periods - Preserve total
returns while maintaining return distribution properties

**Example:**

    Time    A     B           A distributed    B distributed
    t1      1%    NaN         1%              0.5%          # Half of t2's return
    t2      1%    1%          1%              0.5%          # Half of t2's return
    t3      NaN   -1%         0.5%            -1%           # Split A's t4 return
    t4      1%    1%          0.5%            1%            # Split A's t4 return

    Return vectors for A-B:
    A: [1%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.5%]     # Total return = 1%
    B: [0.5%, 0.5%, -1%, 1%]      # Total return = 1%

**Key Properties:** - Maximum information preservation - Natural
variance and distribution properties - Handles lead/lag relationships -
Most computationally intensive - May produce non-PSD correlation matrix

**Implementation Notes for All Methods:**

1.  Return Types:
    -   Methods work with both log and simple returns
    -   Log returns simplify averaging calculations
    -   Simple returns require careful compounding
2.  Averaging Period Choice:
    -   Equal distribution across gap periods
    -   Could be weighted by time if periods unequal
    -   Consider market-specific factors

            Use Synchronized Average
        Else:
            Use Traditional Method

3.  Check Computational Constraints

        If Method 4 selected but computationally infeasible:
            Fallback to Method 2

## PCA - Factor Loadings TimeSeries

To calculate principal components from a correlation matrix and generate
a time series of factor loadings over time from the underlying asset
prices, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Data

1.  **Collect Asset Prices**: Gather historical price data for the
    assets you are interested in.
2.  **Calculate Returns**: Compute the log returns or simple returns
    from the price data.

#### Step 2: Compute the Correlation Matrix

1.  **Standardize Returns**: Standardize the returns to have a mean of 0
    and a standard deviation of 1.
2.  **Correlation Matrix**: Calculate the correlation matrix from the
    standardized returns.

#### Step 3: Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

1.  **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Perform eigenvalue decomposition on
    the correlation matrix to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
2.  **Sort Eigenvalues**: Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and
    arrange the corresponding eigenvectors accordingly.

#### Step 4: Determine the Number of Principal Components

1.  **Variance Explained**: Calculate the cumulative variance explained
    by the principal components.
2.  **Threshold**: Set a threshold (x%) for the variance explained by
    the first n components.
3.  **Select Components**: Determine the number of components (n) that
    explain at least x% of the variance.

#### Step 5: Calculate Factor Loadings

1.  **Factor Loadings**: The factor loadings are the eigenvectors
    corresponding to the selected principal components.

#### Step 6: Generate Time Series of Factor Loadings

1.  **Project Returns**: Project the standardized returns onto the
    selected eigenvectors to obtain the time series of factor loadings.

#### Detailed Steps

##### Step 1: Prepare the Data

``` python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Example: Load asset prices into a DataFrame
asset_prices = pd.read_csv('asset_prices.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

# Calculate log returns
log_returns = np.log(asset_prices / asset_prices.shift(1))
log_returns = log_returns.dropna()
```

##### Step 2: Compute the Correlation Matrix

``` python
# Standardize returns
standardized_returns = (log_returns - log_returns.mean()) / log_returns.std()

# Compute the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = standardized_returns.corr()
```

##### Step 3: Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

``` python
# Eigenvalue decomposition
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(correlation_matrix)

# Sort eigenvalues and eigenvectors
sorted_indices = np.argsort(eigenvalues)[::-1]
sorted_eigenvalues = eigenvalues[sorted_indices]
sorted_eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, sorted_indices]
```

##### Step 4: Determine the Number of Principal Components

``` python
# Calculate cumulative variance explained
cumulative_variance = np.cumsum(sorted_eigenvalues) / np.sum(sorted_eigenvalues)

# Set threshold
threshold = 0.9  # Example: 90%

# Determine the number of components
n_components = np.argmax(cumulative_variance >= threshold) + 1
```

##### Step 5: Calculate Factor Loadings

``` python
# Factor loadings are the eigenvectors corresponding to the selected components
factor_loadings = sorted_eigenvectors[:, :n_components]
```

##### Step 6: Generate Time Series of Factor Loadings

``` python
# Project returns onto the selected eigenvectors
factor_scores = standardized_returns.dot(factor_loadings)

# Factor scores are the time series of factor loadings
factor_scores.columns = [f'Factor {i+1}' for i in range(n_components)]
```

#### Example Output

``` python
print(factor_scores.head())
```

This process will give you the time series of factor loadings over time,
which can be used for further analysis or modeling.

To extend the process to calculate the residual return for each asset,
which represents the idiosyncratic return series, follow these
additional steps:

#### Step 7: Calculate Residual Returns

1.  **Reconstruct Returns**: Use the factor loadings and factor scores
    to reconstruct the returns explained by the principal components.
2.  **Calculate Residuals**: Subtract the reconstructed returns from the
    original standardized returns to obtain the residual returns.

#### Detailed Steps

##### Step 7: Calculate Residual Returns

``` python
# Reconstruct returns using factor loadings and factor scores
reconstructed_returns = factor_scores.dot(factor_loadings.T)

# Calculate residual returns
residual_returns = standardized_returns - reconstructed_returns

# Residual returns are the idiosyncratic return series for each asset
residual_returns.columns = asset_prices.columns
```

#### Full Process Summary

1.  **Prepare the Data**: Collect asset prices and calculate returns.
2.  **Compute the Correlation Matrix**: Standardize returns and compute
    the correlation matrix.
3.  **Perform PCA**: Perform eigenvalue decomposition and sort
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
4.  **Determine the Number of Principal Components**: Set a threshold
    for variance explained and select the number of components.
5.  **Calculate Factor Loadings**: Obtain factor loadings from the
    selected eigenvectors.
6.  **Generate Time Series of Factor Loadings**: Project returns onto
    the selected eigenvectors.
7.  **Calculate Residual Returns**: Reconstruct returns and calculate
    residual returns.

#### Example Code

``` python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Prepare the Data
asset_prices = pd.read_csv('asset_prices.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)
log_returns = np.log(asset_prices / asset_prices.shift(1))
log_returns = log_returns.dropna()

# Step 2: Compute the Correlation Matrix
standardized_returns = (log_returns - log_returns.mean()) / log_returns.std()
correlation_matrix = standardized_returns.corr()

# Step 3: Perform PCA
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(correlation_matrix)
sorted_indices = np.argsort(eigenvalues)[::-1]
sorted_eigenvalues = eigenvalues[sorted_indices]
sorted_eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, sorted_indices]

# Step 4: Determine the Number of Principal Components
cumulative_variance = np.cumsum(sorted_eigenvalues) / np.sum(sorted_eigenvalues)
threshold = 0.9  # Example: 90%
n_components = np.argmax(cumulative_variance >= threshold) + 1

# Step 5: Calculate Factor Loadings
factor_loadings = sorted_eigenvectors[:, :n_components]

# Step 6: Generate Time Series of Factor Loadings
factor_scores = standardized_returns.dot(factor_loadings)
factor_scores.columns = [f'Factor {i+1}' for i in range(n_components)]

# Step 7: Calculate Residual Returns
reconstructed_returns = factor_scores.dot(factor_loadings.T)
residual_returns = standardized_returns - reconstructed_returns
residual_returns.columns = asset_prices.columns

# Example Output
print(residual_returns.head())
```

#### Explanation

-   **Reconstructed Returns**: These are the returns explained by the
    selected principal components.
-   **Residual Returns**: These are the idiosyncratic returns,
    representing the part of the returns that cannot be explained by the
    principal components.

This process will give you the residual returns for each asset, which
can be used for further analysis, such as identifying asset-specific
risks or evaluating the performance of individual assets independent of
market factors.

### Handling Noise in Covariance/Correlation Matrices for Portfolio Optimization

Covariance and correlation matrices play a pivotal role in portfolio
optimization, influencing decisions related to asset allocation, risk
management, and overall portfolio performance. However, estimating these
matrices accurately is often challenging due to the presence of noise,
especially in high-dimensional settings where the number of assets

$$
N
$$

approaches or exceeds the number of observations $$
T
$$

. This noise can lead to unstable estimates, making portfolio
optimization unreliable. To mitigate these issues, various denoising
techniques have been developed, with shrinkage methods being among the
most prominent. Recently, a novel approach called **squeezing** has
emerged, offering enhanced ways to handle noise in covariance matrices.

### Introduction to Noise in Covariance Matrices

In portfolio optimization, especially within the framework of
Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory, the covariance matrix of asset
returns is essential for assessing portfolio risk and optimizing asset
weights. However, accurately estimating this matrix poses significant
challenges:

-   **High Dimensionality**: As the number of assets

    $$
    N
    $$

    increases, the number of unique covariances

    $$
    \frac{N(N-1)}{2}
    $$

    grows rapidly, leading to estimation errors, particularly when $$
    N
    $$

    is comparable to or exceeds $$
    T
    $$

    (the number of observations).

-   **Sample Noise**: Finite sample sizes result in the sample
    covariance matrix

    $$
    S
    $$

    deviating from the true covariance matrix

    $$
    \Sigma
    $$

    , introducing noise that can distort optimization results.

-   **Overfitting**: Excessive reliance on sample estimates can lead to
    overfitting, where the optimized portfolio performs poorly
    out-of-sample despite appearing optimal in-sample.

To address these issues, denoising techniques such as shrinkage have
been developed to produce more stable and reliable covariance estimates.

### Traditional Shrinkage Methods

Shrinkage methods aim to improve covariance matrix estimates by
combining the sample covariance matrix with a structured target matrix.
The primary goal is to balance the trade-off between bias and variance,
reducing estimation error without introducing substantial bias.

#### Ledoit-Wolf Shrinkage Estimator

One of the most influential shrinkage methods is the **Ledoit-Wolf
Shrinkage Estimator**, introduced by Olivier Ledoit and Michael Wolf.
Their approach is designed to provide a well-conditioned covariance
matrix estimator suitable for high-dimensional settings.

The Ledoit-Wolf estimator is given by:

$$
\hat{\Sigma}_{LW} = \delta F + (1 - \delta) S
$$

Where:

-   $$
    \hat{\Sigma}_{LW} $$ is the shrinkage covariance estimator. \$\$
-   $$
    S $$ is the sample covariance matrix. \$\$
-   $$
    F $$ is the structured shrinkage target. A common choice for $$ F $$
    is the identity matrix $$ I $$ scaled by the average variance of the
    sample covariance matrix. This implies that assets are assumed to
    have the same variance and zero correlation. \$\$
-   $$
    \delta $$ is the shrinkage intensity, determining the weight between
    $$ F $$ and $$ S $$. The idea is that the sample covariance matrix
    is "shrunk" towards the structured estimator. In the extreme case
    where $$ \delta = 1 $$, the shrinkage estimator becomes the
    structured estimator, and in the other extreme case where
    $$ \delta = 0 $$, the shrinkage estimator becomes the sample
    covariance matrix. Therefore, the shrinkage intensity can be
    interpreted as a measure of how much the sample covariance matrix is
    shrunk toward the structured estimator. \$\$

\*\*Shrinkage Intensity

$$\delta$$:\*\* The optimal value of $$
\delta
$$

minimizes the expected loss between $$
\hat{\Sigma}_{LW}
$$

and the true covariance matrix $$
\Sigma
$$

. Ledoit and Wolf derived an analytical expression for $$
\delta
$$

under certain assumptions, making their estimator fully automatic and
easily implementable.

#### Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**

-   **Reduced Estimation Error**: By blending the noisy sample
    covariance with a structured target, shrinkage reduces variance
    without heavily biasing the estimate.

-   **Well-Conditioned Matrix**: The shrinkage estimator is more stable
    and invertible, essential for portfolio optimization tasks that
    require matrix inversion.

-   **Automatic Tuning**: The analytical determination of $$
    \delta
    $$

    eliminates the need for cross-validation or other empirical tuning
    methods.

**Limitations:**

-   **Choice of Shrinkage Target**: While the identity matrix is a
    common choice, it assumes homogeneity in variances and zero
    covariances, which may not hold in practice.
-   **Bias Introduction**: Shrinkage introduces bias towards the target
    matrix, which can be detrimental if the target is poorly chosen.

##### Sample Code (Python)

import numpy as np

def ledoit_wolf_shrinkage(returns):
  """
  Computes the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage estimator for a covariance matrix.

  Args:
    returns: A NumPy array of asset returns, with each row representing an asset 
      and each column representing a time period.

  """

  n_assets, n_observations = returns.shape
  sample_cov = np.cov(returns, rowvar=False)
  average_variance = np.trace(sample_cov) / n_assets
  target_cov = average_variance * np.identity(n_assets)
  
  # Calculate shrinkage intensity (details omitted for brevity)
  shrinkage_intensity = ... 

  shrinkage_cov = shrinkage_intensity * target_cov + \
                   (1 - shrinkage_intensity) * sample_cov
  return shrinkage_cov

# Example usage (assuming 'returns' is a NumPy array of asset returns)
shrinkage_estimator = ledoit_wolf_shrinkage(returns)
print(shrinkage_estimator)
```

### Novel Approach: Squeezing

Building upon traditional shrinkage methods, a novel approach termed
**squeezing** has been proposed to more effectively manage noise in
covariance matrices.

#### Conceptual Overview

Unlike standard shrinkage that uniformly shrinks all covariances towards
a single target, squeezing introduces a more nuanced mechanism to
parameterize and control the noise intrinsic to the covariance
estimates. The core idea is to "squeeze" out noise from channels or
specific directions in the covariance structure, allowing for an
objective-specific alignment.

#### Methodology

Squeezing is built upon the concept of an objective-specific correlation
matrix. This means that the covariance matrix used for a given objective
is tailored to that specific objective. To achieve this, squeezing
operates directly on the returns data used to build the covariance
matrix.

The process begins with a standard data matrix, where each row
represents an asset and each column a time period. To create an element
for the covariance matrix between assets *i* and *j*, one projects the
corresponding returns onto the *i-j* plane, creating a collection of
vectors representing the co-movement of the two assets. These vectors
carry information about the size and direction of returns movement.
Traditional methods only consider the quadrant each vector falls into
(positive-positive, positive-negative, etc.), but squeezing uses a
statistical alignment template to further categorize co-movement into
more granular channels based on vector properties.

The heart of the squeezing approach is the **IQ (Informational Quality)
statistic**. The IQ statistic is calculated for each asset pair (i, j)
and is designed to quantify the informational quality of the co-movement
between those assets. It is essentially a normalized net present value
(NPV) of co-movement evidence, taking into account spatial and temporal
discounting factors.

Mathematically, the IQ statistic is represented as:

$$
IQ(s, t) = \frac{\sum_m \nabla_{ij}(t_m; s, \omega) \nu(t_m; t)}{\sqrt{\sum_m \nabla_{ii}(t_m; s, \omega_d) \nu(t_m; t)} \sqrt{\sum_m \nabla_{jj}(t_m; s, \omega_d) \nu(t_m; t)}}
$$

where:

-   $$
    s $$ represents the space-related parameters that control the
    statistical alignment template and channel parameterization. These
    parameters essentially define how the co-movement vectors are
    categorized into different channels. \$\$
-   $$
    t $$ represents the time-related parameters that control the
    temporal discounting of co-movement evidence. These parameters
    address the fact that the co-movement between assets may change over
    time and that the predictive power of historical data decays with
    time. \$\$
-   $$
    \nabla_{ij}(t_m; s, \omega) $$ represents the evidence contribution
    from the co-movement vector at time $$ t_m $$ in the lookback
    window. This term captures the spatial aspects of the co-movement,
    based on where the vector falls within the alignment template. \$\$
-   $$
    \nu(t_m; t) $$ represents the temporal discount factor applied to
    the co-movement evidence. This term accounts for the age of the data
    and potential changes in the underlying relationship between assets.
    \$\$

The IQ statistic is then used to construct the squeezing correlation
matrix, which is subsequently scaled to obtain the squeezing covariance
matrix.

#### Advantages Over Traditional Shrinkage

-   **Granular Noise Control**: Squeezing allows for differentiated
    noise reduction across various components of the covariance matrix,
    rather than a uniform shrinkage. It does so by assigning different
    weights to different channels in the statistical alignment template.
    Channels that are deemed to contain more noise are given lower
    weights, while channels that are deemed to contain less noise are
    given higher weights.
-   **Objective-Specific Optimization**: Parameters can be tuned
    specifically for the portfolio's optimization goals, enhancing
    performance.
-   **Enhanced Flexibility**: The approach can adapt to different
    structures within the covariance matrix, potentially outperforming
    traditional methods in complex scenarios. For example, squeezing can
    be used to account for the fact that correlations tend to be higher
    during market downturns.

#### Sample Code (Python)

Implementing squeezing requires a more involved approach compared to
traditional shrinkage. Below is a basic outline:

``` python
import numpy as np

def calculate_iq_statistic(returns, s, t):
  """
  Calculate the IQ statistic for a pair of assets.
  This is a simplified representation - actual implementation 
  requires significant detail and computation.

  Args:
    returns: A NumPy array of asset returns for the pair.
    s: Space-related parameters for the alignment template.
    t: Time-related parameters for temporal discounting.

  Returns:
    The IQ statistic for the asset pair.
  """
  # Detailed implementation of alignment, channel calculation,
  # temporal discounting, and normalization is required here.
  iq_value = ... 
  return iq_value

def squeezing_covariance(returns, s, t):
  """
  Computes the squeezing covariance matrix.

  Args:
    returns: A NumPy array of asset returns.
    s: Space-related parameters.
    t: Time-related parameters.

  Returns:
    The squeezing covariance matrix.
  """
  n_assets = returns.shape[0]
  cov_matrix = np.zeros((n_assets, n_assets))
  
  for i in range(n_assets):
    for j in range(i, n_assets):
      iq_value = calculate_iq_statistic(returns[[i, j], :], s, t)
      cov_matrix[i, j] = iq_value  # Assuming IQ represents correlation here
      cov_matrix[j, i] = iq_value  # Ensure symmetry

  # Scale the correlation matrix to obtain the covariance matrix
  variances = np.var(returns, axis=1)
  cov_matrix = np.diag(np.sqrt(variances)) @ cov_matrix @ np.diag(np.sqrt(variances))
  return cov_matrix

# Example usage (assuming 'returns' is a NumPy array of asset returns)
# and 's' and 't' are appropriately defined parameters
squeezing_cov = squeezing_covariance(returns, s, t)
print(squeezing_cov)
```

### Other Denoising Techniques

While shrinkage and squeezing are powerful, other denoising methods also
contribute to improving covariance estimates.

#### Random Matrix Theory

**Random Matrix Theory (RMT)** provides tools to distinguish between
signal and noise eigenvalues in large covariance matrices. By analyzing
the spectrum of

$$
S
$$

, RMT can filter out eigenvalues that likely correspond to noise,
retaining only those that carry meaningful information.

#### Factor Models

**Factor Models** assume that asset returns are driven by a few
underlying factors. By modeling the covariance matrix through these
factors, one can effectively reduce dimensionality and mitigate noise.

### Application in Portfolio Optimization

Improved covariance estimates directly translate to better portfolio
optimization outcomes.

#### Impact on Risk Management

-   **Accurate Risk Assessment**: Reliable covariance estimates lead to
    a more precise understanding of portfolio risk.
-   **Diversification**: Enhanced covariance matrices allow for better
    diversification across uncorrelated or low-correlated assets.

#### Enhanced Portfolio Performance

-   **Stable Weights**: Well-conditioned covariance matrices reduce the
    sensitivity of optimal weights to estimation errors, resulting in
    more stable portfolios.
-   **Out-of-Sample Performance**: Denoised covariance estimates lead to
    portfolios that perform better out-of-sample, avoiding the pitfalls
    of overfitting.

### Conclusion

Noise in covariance and correlation matrices poses significant
challenges in portfolio optimization, particularly in high-dimensional
contexts. Traditional shrinkage methods, epitomized by the Ledoit-Wolf
estimator, offer a structured way to reduce estimation error by blending
the sample covariance matrix with a target matrix. However, the choice
of target and uniform shrinkage can limit performance.

The novel approach of **squeezing** extends traditional shrinkage by
introducing a more flexible and objective-specific mechanism to control
noise, potentially offering superior performance in complex portfolio
optimization scenarios. Alongside other denoising techniques like Random
Matrix Theory and Factor Models, squeezing enriches the toolkit
available for quantitative finance practitioners aiming to construct
robust and high-performing portfolios.

## Volatility Forecasting: GARCH and HAR Models

This note provides an overview of volatility forecasting using
Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and
Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) models, assuming realized volatility
(RV) is already calculated.

### Realized Volatility Windows and Forecast Horizons

#### Input Data Structure

The realized volatility input series typically consists of overlapping
windows:

-   For a 20-day RV, each daily observation represents volatility over
    the previous 20 days
-   This overlapping structure provides rich information about
    volatility evolution
-   The HAR model is specifically designed to handle such overlapping
    measurements

#### Forecast Horizon Structure

While inputs may be overlapping, forecasts are made for complete,
non-overlapping future periods:

-   For h=20 day horizon: forecast is for complete period \[t+1 to
    t+20\]
-   For multiple periods: forecasts are for \[t+21 to t+40\], \[t+41 to
    t+60\], etc.
-   Each forecast represents the volatility of a complete future window
-   No mixing of known and unknown returns in forecast windows

#### Example Implementation with Proper Date Alignment

``` python
def forecast_volatility_har(rv_series, n_ahead=1, window=20):
    """
    Forecast volatility for n complete future windows
  
    Args:
        rv_series (pd.Series): Daily series of rolling window RV, indexed by date
        n_ahead (int): Number of complete future windows to forecast
        window (int): Size of RV calculation window (e.g., 20 days)
    
    Returns:
        pd.Series: Forecasts indexed by the date they represent
                  (end of each forecast window)
    """
    # Get last date in input series
    last_date = rv_series.index[-1]
  
    # Generate forecasts
    forecasts = []
    forecast_dates = []
  
    for i in range(n_ahead):
        # Calculate forecast for complete future window
        forecast = generate_window_forecast(rv_series, window)
        forecasts.append(forecast)
    
        # Calculate the date this forecast represents
        # (end of complete window)
        forecast_date = last_date + pd.Timedelta(days=window*(i+1))
        forecast_dates.append(forecast_date)
  
    # Return as time series
    return pd.Series(forecasts, index=forecast_dates)

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Assuming we have RV series up to Nov 1, 2023
    forecast = forecast_volatility_har(rv_series, n_ahead=3, window=20)
  
    # This would output forecasts for:
    # - Nov 21, 2023 (first complete window)
    # - Dec 11, 2023 (second complete window)
    # - Dec 31, 2023 (third complete window)
  
    # Easy comparison with realized values
    comparison = pd.DataFrame({
        'forecast': forecast,
        'realized': realized_vol  # actual RV when available
    })
```

#### Date Alignment Considerations:

1.  **Forecast Dates**

    -   First forecast: t + window_size days
    -   Second forecast: t + (2 Ã window_size) days
    -   nth forecast: t + (n Ã window_size) days

2.  **Business Day Adjustments** (optional enhancement)

``` python
def get_forecast_dates(start_date, n_ahead, window):
    """
    Get proper business day aligned forecast dates
    """
    forecast_dates = []
    current_date = start_date
  
    for i in range(n_ahead):
        # Add business days for window
        forecast_date = pd.date_range(
            start=current_date, 
            periods=window, 
            freq='B'  # business day frequency
        )[-1]
    
        forecast_dates.append(forecast_date)
        current_date = forecast_date + pd.Timedelta(days=1)
  
    return forecast_dates
```

3.  **Typical Usage**

``` python
# For November 1, 2023 with 20-day window:
#
# Input RV series:
# 2023-10-13 to 2023-11-01 (current window)
#
# First forecast window:
# 2023-11-02 to 2023-11-21 
#
# Second forecast window:
# 2023-11-22 to 2023-12-11
```

This date alignment is crucial for:

-   Proper forecast evaluation
-   Comparing forecast vs realized volatility
-   Risk management applications
-   Portfolio rebalancing decisions

### 1. GARCH Volatility Forecasting: Methodology and Implementation

#### Introduction to GARCH Models

GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models
are particularly effective for volatility forecasting because they
capture three key features of financial market volatility: 1. Volatility
clustering (periods of high volatility tend to persist) 2. Mean
reversion (volatility tends to return to a long-term average) 3.
Asymmetric response to market movements (volatility often reacts
differently to positive and negative returns)

#### GARCH(1,1) Model Specification

The GARCH(1,1) model represents the conditional variance ÏÂ²t as:

ÏÂ²t = Ï + Î±âÎµÂ²(t-1) + Î²âÏÂ²(t-1)

where: - Ï (omega): Weight given to long-run average variance - Î±
(alpha): Reaction coefficient - measures how strongly volatility reacts
to market movements - Î² (beta): Persistence coefficient - indicates how
long volatility shocks persist - ÎµÂ²(t-1): Previous period's squared
return - ÏÂ²(t-1): Previous period's variance

Parameter constraints: - Ï \> 0 - Î± â¥ 0 - Î² â¥ 0 - Î± + Î² \< 1 (for
stationarity)

#### Types of Volatility Estimates

##### 1. Instantaneous Volatility

-   Represents the volatility at a specific point in time
-   For daily data, this is the one-day-ahead forecast
-   Used as the starting point for multi-period forecasts

##### 2. N-Period Ahead Forecasts

-   Individual volatility forecasts for specific future periods
-   Accounts for mean reversion in forecasts
-   Calculated recursively using GARCH parameters

##### 3. Average Volatility

-   Represents the average volatility over a future time window
-   Calculated as the square root of the average variance over the
    period
-   Critical for option pricing and risk management

#### Implementation Structure

``` python

    def __init__(self, returns_series):
        self.returns = returns_series

#### Parameter Estimation and Model Diagnostics

##### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

The GARCH parameters are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood
function:

L = -0.5 \* Î£(log(ÏÂ²t) + ÎµÂ²t/ÏÂ²t)

Two estimation approaches are supported: 1. Full maximum likelihood
(estimates all parameters) 2. Variance targeting (fixes Ï based on
sample variance)

##### Model Diagnostics

Key metrics to assess model fit: 1. Parameter significance
(t-statistics) 2. Standardized residuals analysis 3. Log-likelihood
value 4. Information criteria (AIC, BIC)

##### Parameter Interpretation

-   Î±: Reaction to news (typically 0.05-0.15)
-   Î²: Persistence (typically 0.8-0.9)
-   Î± + Î²: Total persistence (should be \< 1)
-   Ï/(1-Î±-Î²): Long-run variance

#### Practical Considerations

##### Sample Size Requirements

-   Minimum 2 years of daily data recommended
-   Larger samples improve parameter stability
-   Consider data frequency (daily preferred)

##### Model Stability Checks

1.  Parameter bounds (0 â¤ Î±,Î² â¤ 1)
2.  Persistence check (Î± + Î² \< 1)
3.  Standard errors of parameters
4.  Comparison with simpler models (EWMA)

##### Advanced Applications

1.  Confidence intervals for forecasts
2.  Term structure analysis
3.  Option pricing applications
4.  Risk management metrics

### 2. HAR Models

#### Methodology

HAR models exploit persistence in realized volatility by modeling it as
a function of lagged values over different time horizons. The model can
be specified in two forms:

**Standard HAR:**

$$
RV_{t+h} = \beta_0 + \beta_D RV_t + \beta_W RV_t^W + \beta_M RV_t^M + \epsilon_t
$$

**Centered HAR (Improved Specification):**

$$
RV_{t+h} - \overline{RV_t} = \beta_D(RV_t - \overline{RV_t}) + \beta_W(RV_t^W - \overline{RV_t}) + \beta_M(RV_t^M - \overline{RV_t}) + \epsilon_t
$$

where:

-   $RV_{t+h}$: Realized volatility at time *t+h*
-   $RV_t$, $RV_t^W$, $RV_t^M$: Daily, weekly, monthly RV
-   $\overline{RV_t}$: Expanding mean of RV up to time *t*
-   $\beta_0$, $\beta_D$, $\beta_W$, $\beta_M$: Regression coefficients

#### Implementation Steps

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    -   Calculate daily, weekly, monthly lagged RV
    -   For centered version, calculate expanding mean
2.  **Model Fitting:** Estimate coefficients using OLS
3.  **Forecasting:** Generate forecasts using fitted model

#### HAR Model Implementation

The HAR model uses overlapping components at different frequencies to
capture volatility persistence patterns. Default lags are empirically
motivated:

-   Daily frequency: 1-day lag (previous RV)
-   Weekly frequency: 5-day lag (approximately one trading week)
-   Monthly frequency: 22-day lag (approximately one trading month)

For different data frequencies, these defaults adjust proportionally: -
Weekly data: 1-week, 4-week, 12-week lags - Monthly data: 1-month,
3-month, 12-month lags

#### Key Points About HAR Components:

1.  **Overlapping Nature**
    -   RV_D: Single previous period
    -   RV_W: Rolling average over weekly horizon
    -   RV_M: Rolling average over monthly horizon
    -   All components share some overlapping data
2.  **Default Lag Structure**

<!-- -->

    Daily Data (D):
    - Daily: t-1
    - Weekly: t-5 to t-1 (avg)
    - Monthly: t-22 to t-1 (avg)

    Weekly Data (W):
    - Weekly: t-1
    - Monthly: t-4 to t-1 (avg)
    - Quarterly: t-12 to t-1 (avg)

    Monthly Data (M):
    - Monthly: t-1
    - Quarterly: t-3 to t-1 (avg)
    - Annual: t-12 to t-1 (avg)

3.  **Empirical Evidence**

-   Default lags based on extensive research
-   Capture market dynamics at different frequencies
-   Proven robust across different markets and time periods
