# Handling Non-overlapping Data in Financial Time Series Analysis

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Missing Data Challenge in Financial Time Series

Financial time series frequently encounter missing or non-overlapping data, presenting significant challenges for quantitative analysis, risk management, and portfolio optimization. This issue is particularly acute in daily and higher-frequency data, where market-specific factors create systematic patterns of missing observations.

### 1.2 Sources of Missing Data

#### Market Structure Factors
1. **Different Trading Calendars**
   - National holidays
   - Religious observances
   - Market-specific holidays
   - Emergency closures

2. **Time Zone Differences**
   - Asynchronous trading hours
   - Partial day overlaps
   - Market open/close sequences
   - Daylight saving time transitions

3. **Market-Specific Events**
   - Trading halts
   - Circuit breakers
   - Early market closes
   - Technical disruptions
   - Regulatory suspensions

4. **Cross-Asset Considerations**
   - Different asset class trading hours
   - OTC vs. exchange trading
   - Regional market differences
   - ADR/underlying synchronization

### 1.3 Impact on Financial Analysis

#### Statistical Implications
1. **Correlation Estimation**
   - Biased estimates from missing data
   - Underestimation of co-movements
   - Missing crucial market events
   - Lead/lag relationship distortion

2. **Risk Measures**
   - Incomplete volatility capture
   - Correlation matrix issues
   - Systematic risk underestimation
   - Spurious diversification effects

3. **Portfolio Analytics**
   - Optimization challenges
   - Risk decomposition issues
   - Performance attribution gaps
   - Rebalancing timing problems

#### Practical Challenges

```
Example: Global Equity Portfolio
Time(UTC)   US     Japan  Germany  Action Required
09:00       Closed Open   Open     Handle pre-US market
16:00       Open   Closed Open     Update Japan with lag
22:00       Closed Closed Closed   End-of-day alignment
```

### 1.4 Frequency Dependence

The severity and nature of missing data problems vary significantly by frequency:

| Frequency | Missing Data Prevalence | Primary Causes | Impact |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|---------|
| Intraday | Very High | Time zones, Trading hours | Critical |
| Daily | High | Holidays, Market closures | Significant |
| Weekly | Low | Extended market closures | Minor |
| Monthly | Very Low | Extreme events only | Minimal |

### 1.5 Example: Missing Data Impact

Consider a global portfolio during a Japanese holiday:

```
Date        Japan   US      Europe
2024-01-01  Holiday +1%     +0.8%
2024-01-02  +1.5%   -0.2%   -0.1%
```

Traditional approaches might:
1. Discard 01-01 completely
2. Miss the catch-up effect in Japanese markets
3. Underestimate correlations
4. Miss risk transmission patterns

### 1.6 The Need for Sophisticated Approaches

Simple solutions like:
- Discarding incomplete observations
- Basic interpolation
- Carrying forward last values

Are often inadequate because they:
- Lose valuable information
- Introduce artificial patterns
- Fail to capture market dynamics
- Create statistical biases

### 1.7 Framework Requirements

An effective missing data handling framework must:
1. Preserve total returns
2. Maintain statistical properties
3. Capture lead/lag relationships
4. Support various analytical applications
5. Be computationally feasible
6. Handle different data frequencies appropriately

The following sections present four methodologies that address these requirements in different ways, each with specific strengths for particular use cases and data frequencies.


## 2. Methodologies

### 2.1 Traditional All-Overlapping (Method 1)

**Description:**
- Discard all time periods where any series has missing data
- Use only periods where all series have valid returns
- Simplest but most restrictive approach

**Example:**
```
Time    X     Y     Z     Action
t1      1%    1%    1%    Include
t2      NaN   1%    1%    Discard entirely
t3      2%    -1%   1%    Include

Return vectors:
X: [1%, 2%]
Y: [1%, -1%]
Z: [1%, 1%]
```

**Key Properties:**
- Guarantees equal length series
- Maintains matrix properties
- Maximum information loss
- Fastest computation

### 2.2 Synchronized Average (Method 2)

**Description:**
- Keep all series synchronized
- For missing periods, distribute returns evenly across the gap
- Preserves total price movements while maintaining natural return variance

**Example:**
```
Time    X     Y     Z        Action
t1      1%    1%    NaN      Average Z's t2 return over t1,t2
t2      2%    1%    2%       Average Z's t2 return over t1,t2
t3      1%    1%    1%       Use directly

Return vectors:
X: [1%, 2%, 1%]
Y: [1%, 1%, 1%]
Z: [1%, 1%, 1%]    # t2's 2% return split evenly across t1,t2
```

**Key Properties:**
- Maintains matrix properties
- Better variance representation than cumulative approach
- Preserves total returns
- Natural return distribution

### 2.3 Pairwise Overlapping (Method 3)

**Description:**
- Consider each pair of series independently
- Use only overlapping periods for each pair
- Different periods may be used for different pairs

**Example:**
```
Time    A     B     C     
t1      1%    1%    NaN   
t2      1%    NaN   1%    
t3      1%    1%    1%    

Pairwise vectors:
A-B: A[t1,t3], B[t1,t3]
A-C: A[t2,t3], C[t2,t3]
B-C: B[t3], C[t3]

Return vectors for A-B:
A: [1%, 1%]
B: [1%, 1%]
```

**Key Properties:**
- More observations than Method 1
- Different effective periods for each pair
- May produce non-PSD correlation matrix
- Higher computational requirements

### 2.4 Pairwise Average (Method 4)

**Description:**
- Consider each pair independently
- For gaps, distribute returns evenly across missing periods
- Preserve total returns while maintaining return distribution properties

**Example:**
```
Time    A     B           A distributed    B distributed
t1      1%    NaN         1%              0.5%          # Half of t2's return
t2      1%    1%          1%              0.5%          # Half of t2's return
t3      NaN   -1%         0.5%            -1%           # Split A's t4 return
t4      1%    1%          0.5%            1%            # Split A's t4 return

Return vectors for A-B:
A: [1%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.5%]     # Total return = 1%
B: [0.5%, 0.5%, -1%, 1%]      # Total return = 1%
```

**Key Properties:**
- Maximum information preservation
- Natural variance and distribution properties
- Handles lead/lag relationships
- Most computationally intensive
- May produce non-PSD correlation matrix

**Implementation Notes for All Methods:**

1. Return Types:
   - Methods work with both log and simple returns
   - Log returns simplify averaging calculations
   - Simple returns require careful compounding

2. Averaging Period Choice:
   - Equal distribution across gap periods
   - Could be weighted by time if periods unequal
   - Consider market-specific factors

3. Matrix Properties:
   - Methods 1 & 2: Guaranteed PSD
   - Methods 3 & 4: May require adjustment

4. Memory Considerations:
   - Methods 1 & 2: Single return matrix
   - Methods 3 & 4: Separate storage for each pair

### 4.3 Implementation Framework

```python
# Pseudocode framework for method selection
def select_method(frequency, application, computational_resources):
    if frequency > 'daily':  # intraday
        if application == 'DTW':
            return 'Pairwise Average'
        return 'Synchronized Average'
    
    elif frequency == 'daily':
        if application == 'DTW':
            return 'Pairwise Average'
        elif application in ['MVO', 'PCA', 'risk_model']:
            return 'Synchronized Average'
        return 'Traditional'
    
    else:  # weekly or lower frequency
        return 'Traditional'
```

### 4.4 Special Considerations

#### Data Quality
- Monitor proportion of missing data
- Consider frequency adjustment if too sparse
- Document handling of extreme cases

### 4.5 Decision Tree for Method Selection

1. Check Data Frequency
   ```
   If frequency <= weekly:
       Use Traditional Method
   Else:
       Continue to 2
   ```

2. Check Application
   ```
   If DTW or lead/lag critical:
       Use Pairwise Average (computational resources permitting)
   Elif matrix properties critical (MVO, PCA, Risk):
       Use Synchronized Average
   Else:
       Use Traditional Method
   ```

3. Check Computational Constraints
   ```
   If Method 4 selected but computationally infeasible:
